      Some stories are easy but telling them is hard. Like shoplifting – numbers are up, experts and academic literature points to numbers rising usually when inflation is up. But how to tell that story visually? It took me four full business days to find a shopowner willing to talk on camera.

      With finally new census data out, I took a deep dive into the numbers to confirm what experts have been saying about Berlin’s housing market for years: A couple of landlords own most of the city and its a renters’ city, giving landlords a lot of sway.

I looked at the numbers and filmed at a renters’ demonstration – pictures that were used in several news pieces as well.

      On June 6th, the European Central Bank for the first time in years lowered interest rates – signalling the worst of inflation is over. But how to translate this important but technical message to a general audience on instagram? We went with the price for Döner Kebab that had been in the press just weeks earlier to explain why the central bank won’t make things cheaper again. Importantly, we we...
