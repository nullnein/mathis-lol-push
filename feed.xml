      How to report about Germany’s recession – again? Let’s play Für Elise and have a motor humm slowly.

Some thoughts while reporting: With personal savings rates up and stimying growth, a fiscal stimulus would mostly have to be about psychologically freeing consumers up. Which means the stimulus would have to be gigantic.

      When the world meets to show its industrial might, it meets for a competition.

Here is a German version.

      Some stories are easy but telling them is hard. Like shoplifting – numbers are up, experts and academic literature points to numbers rising usually when inflation is up. But how to tell that story visually? It took me four full business days to find a shopowner willing to talk on camera.

      With finally new census data out, I took a deep dive into the numbers to confirm what experts have been saying about Berlin’s housing market for years: A couple of landlords own most of the city and its a renters’ city, giving landlords a lot of sway.

I looked at the numbers and filmed at a renters’ demonstration – pictures that were used in several news pieces as well.
