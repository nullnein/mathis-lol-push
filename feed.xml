      I think it is power that excites people about economics stories.

For this series, a team at DW put together visual first, 3 Minute TikTok videos; stories of “geoeconomcis”.

The term is a catchphrase. I think of it as a refocussing on what Susan Strange did. The journalist brought a practicioner’s perspective to studying International Political Economy.

The initial season ran for five episode...

      I’ll hand it to the 41 pages of Stephen Miran’s “User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System” that they are intriguingly written from an economics point of view. 41 pages stuffed with economic heterodoxy, defying for example the orthodoxy that tariffs are inflationary and cleverly recombining foreign and economic policy–it’s a true document of political economy.

In the paper, Miran...

      For this 25 Minute documentary, I met hackers across Europe who say they were able to tap into solar power generators remotely. The amounts of power they say they had access to is so large, that it could threaten the balance of Europe’s power grid.

In a time of hybrid warfare, the political pressure to ramp up security is on…
