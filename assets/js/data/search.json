I own all the files that I’ve written. I’ve configured it in a way that it’s super easy searchable, I try to tag well and I just couldn’t find another solution that the setup I use: It’s a jekyll site – which means I write plain-text files and develop them with a command-line tool called Jekyll. That means, I don’t get a shiny app to input my writing.It’s automatic, babyIf you’ve used a CMS like Wordpress before, you know the CMS makes stuff easy for you, like you can drag and drop a picture into your editor or there is a form where you just have to input your tags and post title.This website is run with jekyll, a cms that mostly lives in the Terminal.That means from a usability point of view, I’m kind of loosing versus shiny web applications.But I use espanso, to make it slightly easier. Espanso is a text-expander for Windows, macOS and Linux that lets you do stuff like, type :date and it outputs “2024-12-07” or whatever the current date is.It still feels like magic every time.Its a very handy tool that you can use for anything that you type repeatedly. I have it setup for my phone number, my adress and I let it tell me poor dad jokes.Yea, quality isn’t guaranteed on this one.I use espanso to fill in some things around this jekyll site. Thoughts and suggestions are welcome.Adding metadataThis one is the basic functionality as shown above or below.Typing :newpost prints a yaml header for a jekyll blog post. You then have to go back and fill it in. Its similar to the commandIt’s still automatic, babyThe espanso trigger for this is the following.  - trigger: \":newpost\"    replace: \"---\\ndate: \\nauthor: \\ntags:\\ncategory:\\ntitle:\\n---\"    vars:      - name: mydate        type: date        params:          format: \"%Y-%m-%d\"You can download the package on espanso hub.Easy image handlingTyping ![Alt-Text](/assets/img/)*putyourcaptionhere* yields a basic markdown image prompt but points to my central storage for images, where I can paste the image title directly, because the pointer moved there directly. I then fill in alt-text and can publish a caption. It appears just as it does below this gif.I don’t quite remember how I implemented these captions. It had something to do with manipulating css files. I will have to dig to document that another time.The espanso trigger for this is below. I will upload as a package soon.  - trigger: \":img\"    replace: \"![Alt-Text](/assets/img/$|$)\\n*putyourcaptionhere*\"Tags made simplerI start my writing mostly in SublimeText. It allows to autocomplete tags. I don’t know how it does that.seriously, no clue but sets it appart from iA Writer. I think Visual Studio can do something similar.iA Writer for the view,I mean, I don’t know. Its just quite pretty and I use it for most of my writing anyway. I have the _posts folder setup as one of my locations. Its okay."

Now, a novel mechanism for its hydrogen strategy could become a blueprint for future infrastructure spending.Link to full piece at DWThis is a story I came across while reporting on Germany’s Ruhr area switching from coal to hydrogen. To make the move, the country needs a set of pipelines to transport H2 from A to B.But infrastructure investments are tricky in Germany, given strict fiscal rules of the Schuldenbremse, a constitutional law that restricts how much the federal government can borrow. To make the hydrogen move happen, a new financial mechanism was voted into law and it could become a blueprint for similar large scale investments in the future.I was happy to get the chance to write about some inner workings of German fiscal policy. And I do actually think this is an interesting story to watch as we head into an election year, while every party seems to look for spending options around the debt break.

    "content": "Germany’s push towards hydrogen comes at a crucial phase of struggling industry in the country. The government is still trying to agree on how to finance a core aspect of this transition. But once through, it could be a blueprint for fiscal, industrial policy in Germany.Watch the Video-VersionAn industry struggling to changeGermany’s Ruhrgebiet region is set to profit massively from its infrastructural position in the country’s push for hydrogen. Sitting in the west of Germany, close to the border with the Netherlands, it is already linked to the port of Rotterdam for LNG and coal shipments. This infrastructure is set to be updated to allow for hydrogen imports through the port of Rotterdam from global suppliers, as Germany seeks to diversify its energy consumption.The hydrogen and fuel cell center ZBT in Duisburg – a Ruhrgebiet city with an industrial port – is a research and policy institute of the University of Duisburg and has for twenty years poured into hydrogen. They showed me how they coated hydrogen fuel cells with a seal that allows for the chemical process of power generation with these cells.Fuel cells coated at ZBT in Duisburg. Picture credit: Manuel VehringThe story of the Ruhrgebiet is larger however. Germany’s push for hydrogen rests on many different pillars at once: There is research like at ZBT. They argue for example, that hydrogen may not be the best for cars - battery’s may be better. But for larger vehicles, trains or trucks, hydrogen has advantages.The difficulty is getting the hydrogen to where it’s used.In November 2023, the federal government announced its plans to invest in what it calls a »national hydrogen core network«. The proposed plan is, to build new pipelines and update existing tubes to transport hydrogen through the country. This network is supposed to connect at nodes to ports, like Hamburg or the recently and incredibly quickly built German LNG terminals that are said to be upgradable to import hydrogen later.Proposed Core Hydrogen Network. Picture credit: Google Earth Studio, FNB Gas, Mathis RichtmannBig plans but where is the money?Germany’s recent strong push for hydrogen came in wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Recently, the federal government announced plans to invest in power stations run with LNG and possibly later hydrogen to grant energy security during downtime of renewables.But behind the scenes some in the hydrogen industry now wonder though whether the government’s inertia has lost steam. The November 2023 announcements of plans to invest in the core hydrogen network did get approval from the Bundestag and went live as laws just after Christmas 2023. But a small little detail didn’t pass in this round of lawmaking: The paragraphs that would have clarified how the federal government intended to finance the investment.Image gallery at Zeche Zollverein Museum, a museum dedicated to the coal mining business of the Ruhrgebiet region. Picture credit: Manuel VehringThe government’s plan had been to essentially give credit insurance to the private industry to build this network. The estimated 19.8 bn Euro costs are expected to be covered by the private sector users of the network - similar to the deals used in other pipeline networks in the country as well.Because maintaining a network of this infrastructure is done as a monopoly market, the government sets a price cap on profits extracted from running this business.As a financing scheme to build the network, the government had intends to front-load the investment costs and be repaid by the private sector users until 2040.But crucial financing paragraphs §28r and §28s didn’t make the bill. It has been accepted in an initial hearing on January 18th. The executing company for the network planning – FNB Gas – told me in an email, they still expect to start construction this year but the legislative and regulatory approval process may take until summer1.German text of proposed bill on financing the hydrogen network, showing that the federal government insures losses on the investment costs after an initial period until December 31st 2055. Source: Deutscher BundestagThe financing mechanism the coalition government proposes is new to the toolkit of fiscal engineering around the country’s financial straightjacket. The constitutional debt break makes it hard for German politics to invest in infrastructure. But with the newly invented »Amortisationskonto«, possible debt is pushed so far into the future, that nobody complains (yet).The idea is to debt finance the private sector investments until end of 2055. If then gaps in its financing remain, the private sector will carry 24 percent of the losses and the federal government the rest.As of late 2023, the total cost estimate was the mentioned 19.8 bn Euro. If I’ll just be blunt here: It seems to me, these costs could rise until 2055.The way I understand the current bill, the government insures this investment against inflation until 2055 - a sensible move in an inflationary environment that needs investments.What struck me though was what happened when I asked the responsible Ministry for Economics Affairs and Climate Action on what they estimated how large the losses may get: »The financing model and the assumptions on which it is based are being checked for plausibility by an external expert opinion commissioned by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection. The report will be available before the legislative process is completed.«2The legislative process therefore is making a law without considering the potential losses of its investment because these losses haven’t been determined yet.Mathis Richtmann; Picture credit: Sophia HarkeHydrogen is clean but what about jobs?The policy implications of Germany’s hydrogen transition are broader however, than just fiscal policy. The Ruhrgebiet region has been transitioning out of coal production for decades. It used to be the country’s powerhouse: Where coal meets steel. With coal’s decline, the region suffered economically and still has high unemployment levels. But this inequality is regionally disparate. It clusters in a South-North pattern. Southern districts stopped digging for coal earlier.This 2012 map shows3 regional differences inequality: In areas indicated in red relatively more people receive unemployment benefits.Picture credit: Bogumil et al. (2012) as cited in Umweltbundesamt (2021), Page 44; DW GraphicsOn the map, I indicated the three remaining coking plants in the region. The plants make coke from coal that is a crucial steelmaking ingredient. With the steel industry pushing away from using fossil fuels and government subsidies, German steelmakers want to increasingly use hydrogen to supplant coke.Workers at the remaining coking plants just settled with their employers for less work paid in the coming years.But there are job potentials in the transition to hydrogen, Vanessa Hünnemeyer of iW Consult told me. She just recently published a ranking of regions in Germany and how well positioned they are to succeed with hydrogen. The Ruhrgebiet comes out top. Hünnemeyer said, the additional jobs would come out of the adjacent manufacturing sectors, the metals and chemicals industries, where re-training to use hydrogen as a new power source could boost job growth.But private sector investors are getting uneasy. With the delayed financing for the core network and the downsizing of crucial climate financing through the Climate and Transition Fund, the government has much explaining to do on how rigorously it is set to push for hydrogen.Kokerei Schwelgern where workers will see hours and pay reduced. Picture Credit: Google Earth Studio, Mathis RichtmannOne way of indicating such intent would be to publicly acknowledge how high it intends to insure the hydrogen core network investment. I am looking forward to what the »external expert opinion« commissioned by the government will calculate as  a worst-case scenario for investment costs in excess of the current 19.8 bn Euro.How the proposed financing mechanism avoids political gridlockThe proposed financing mechanism would push potential losses into 2056. Last year, the government’s past policy on navigating around the debt break faltered: It had pushed infrastructure financing into shadow balance sheets like the challenged Climate and Transition Fund. This new approach called »Amortisationskonto« / »amortisation account«4 tries to flip the financing on its head:The off-balance-sheet model of shadow funds had relied on the notion of putting an imaginary sum of money into a government fund, issuing that as debt and using the proceeds to pay for things. The Amortisationskonto changes that in a revival of the Public-Private-Partnership. Rather than putting up a sum, the government insures potential losses of the private sector. Since any forecast in the year of 2024 for how high these losses may be at the end of 2055 may include a small margin of error, the mechanism cleverly pushes the financing question so far into the future, that it avoids political gridlock in the current fragile coalition government.Footnotes            »der nächste Schritt auf dem Weg zur Realisierung des Kernnetzes ist die Abgabe des formellen Antrags durch die FNB.

    "content": "Lea Steininger and I published in Cambridge Journal of Economics. The paper explores decision making of central bankers.Bureaucratic familiarityManaging money isn’t an easy job. When money is tight, central bankers usually step in. So in a crisis, they check out what they have at their disposal to increase liquidity, that is money in the system. They ask: What’s worked before? They tinker with a gauge, they try new things. At some point though, they’ll say: “Well that’s a nice fix we’ve got here, should we keep it or ditch it?”This paper explores how central bankers decide in such a situation. It draws on archival research on meeting minutes of central bankers of the US Federal Reserve and interviews with policy makers and market participants at the time.It concludes that central bankers basically prefer what we call “bureaucratic familiarity”. They like to know that both market participants and they themselves know a backup is in place.You can read the full paper here: Full paperAbstract-The permanent international lender of last resort consists of a swap line network between six major central banks (C6), centring around the US Federal Reserve. Arguably, this network is a solution to a long-debated problem as it provides public emergency liquidity provision to the world’s largest financial market, the Eurodollar market. Drawing on exclusive interviews with monetary technocrats as well as a textual analysis of Federal Open Market Committee meeting transcripts over the course of 14 years, we reconstruct how this facility came into being. Building on Kalyanpur and Newman (2017) and Braun (2015), we develop an interpretive framework of bricolage to contextualise its formation: in times of crisis, central bankers rely on retrospection, experimentation and creative re-deployment to develop their tools. In non-crisis times, however, the tools that prevail are those that offer what we call ‘bureaucratic familiarity’: the C6 swap line network became a permanent feature of international finance because technocrats had got used to it.Paper presented at  ‘EAEPE’ Conference – Critical Macro Finance Track, Bilbao (online), 2-4 September 2020  ‘Intersections of Finance and Society’, City University London, 12-13 December 2019  ‘THE EURO AT 20 – MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES’, FMM Conference, Berlin, 24-26 October 2019  ‘Widerspruch’, Momentum Kongress, Hallstatt, 10-13 October 2019"

    "content": "It is a strange time to begin a career in journalism: Vice - the media company I grew up with - just went out of business, layoffs have been gripping the industry for years and now AI is further set to decimate my career.I have trained as a journalist with German broadcaster Deutsche Welle for the past 17 months, switching over from a career as an economist. Will AI kill my career before I even start it?I think not, if I am able to push for a  career as a reporter. To come to this conclusion, I need to make a couple of assumptions on where the future is headed - some of which may be wrong.How will AI change journalism?I think there are two pathways into this question: One is to look at AI as an innovation that will transform the technological foundations of journalism. The other is on its impact on the editorial process.How AI may change journalists’ technolgical foundationThis pathway of looking at AI is a simple function of how technology has shaped production processes in the past. Enhancements in typewriters, later computer technology, online publishing, and most recently mobile live streaming technology has been a simple trend: An incremental removal of barriers between reporting and publishing.As recently as 2005, multiple TV stations would share a relay truck to report on the devastations of hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The relay truck would allow for live reporting via satellite, accesed through a huge dish on the truck’s roof. A the time, reporters, producers and camera people would edit TV pieces in a car, plugging a mobile editing station into the car’s 12 Volt lighter outlet, to edit the tapes they had used to record scenes of the hurricane aftermath.Today, mobile service permitting, we can do lives through the LiveU app on an iPhone and technically edit on a smartphone and publish on social media directly.I’m not advertising that these technological changes have made journalism neccessarily better. The point is rather, to showcase how technology has cut out pieces of hardware and human labor between reporting and publishing.So how may AI change this technological foundation? I have for example brought up a thought experiment, that in 20 years from now, autonomous drones will film on the ground reporters and relay live video streams that may be edited, cut, packaged, and delivered through an AI platform. In this thought experiment, AI mostly changes the editing process of video: If there is a constant stream of video feeding an AI editing model, this model could edit various versions of output from the same material: I would walk through the wreckage of the next natural catastrophe, a swarm of drones would capture video on this and other scenes around it and the model would recombine the video into packages following user preferences.Jane from Nebraska may like to get a written report of what happened, Tejesh from Bengalore may enjoy an imersive virtual reality experience of the catastrophe. It seems to me very much within the scope of the technological trajectory that within the next 20 years such a process is automated.This doesn’t mean that there won’t be any jobs for video editors or cutters anymore. But I would expect them to rather be in commercial spaces that have more funding from leasure spending, such as cinema or whatever comes out of the whole VR/metaverse trend.If technology has mostly chipped away at the barriers between reporting and publishing, jobs in between will be affected. This includes camera people, editors and what I guess we call content editors now - people who basically publish content on various platforms.As a young reporter that means, learning to film is smart because we’ll be doing everything ourselves anyway. But don’t get too caught up in it. Because machines will take those parts over.How could AI change editorial processes?From what I understand of recent AI developments, they congregate around three functions: Accessing, structuring and recombining available data.This is true for both Large Language Models (LLM) like ChatGPT and visual generators such as DALL-E.My basic assumption about how AI processes will  develop over the next two decades is a shortening of what “available data” is. ChatGPT now is trained with data until September 2021. Let’s assume that over the course of 10 years, it has access to not just what happened until yesterday but also to Reuters, Bloomberg or AP feeds.Now, this is an huge assumption for two reasons: On the one hand, acccess to information is extremely costly and the way I thing about systems in general is, that they bifurcate. This means: I would expect access to information to increasingly separate into walled-off silos. As corporations try to squeeze margins, you’ll get a Bloomberg feed in your Terminal, but nothing else. Maybe your operating system may just be compatible with one data provider because Microsoft bought Thomson Reuters.On the other hand, the required computing power to make information accessible the above cannot be overstated from today’s point of view. The current cost estimate for a single request to ChatGPT stands at up to $14. This will obviously decrease with increased computing power, but I think it is fair to say that it will be quite hard to have information instantly accessible.But even given these caveats, I think it is within reason to expect LLMs to compete with each other over what information they have available and in turn decrease the time between an event and a request being possible on this event.This will bring new business models with it. But why would I have subscription to a newspaper if my AI curated app could just provide the information it gathers from various agencies. And experiments to this effect are already in place.Put differently, I think it is within reason that over the next decades media organisations that rely on agency footage or information are cut out of the competition. Because technology will simply take over the processing of agency material and either directly serve it to customers or have a handful of curators do that.But I do think there is huge space for media organisations, yet.Isn’t journalism more than agency stuff?Current AI models provide access, structuring and recombination of available information.Journalism additionally comprises of, accessing  previously unavailable data and analysis and the ability to provide emotional anchors. Three lessons draw from this perspective.Human structuring and recombinationAfter I had come up with the above classification of journalism, I had asked Chat-GPT-3 about what journalism is and was pleased to see that the internet on average seemed to define the field as »gathering, analyzing, and presenting news and information«. With regards to analysis, AI models can and will fundamentally change journalism.The ability to crawl through troves of data will make AI-tools a new friend for investigative journalists. Recently, German outlets Der Spiegel and ZDF published a story on German fighter pilots who after their flying days ended, found new jobs as instructors for the Chinese military. The journalists apparently had found this story by taking a new dive into the Panama Papers leaked more than seven years ago. This shows, how many thus far uncovered stories may sit in these datasets. AI capabilities could help sift through these large datasets.But especially in political journalism it is the ability of a seasoned reporter to know and understand trajectories of decision making, maybe the character of decision makers, the historical and cultural aspects of events, that allows for superior analysis. This knowledge coupled with access to people and events allows for a deep explanation how and why President Biden’s economic policy is fundamentally different from previous democratic presidents. The author has a historic overview and is thus able to ask the right questions. An LLM may be able to trace how certain think tankers moved into government and how suddenly its all about racial job equity with Biden. But it would have either be prompted to these questions or the respective analysis would have to already be published elsewhere.Accessing previously unavailable dataBut doing is what the human reporter can do. They can ask questions at press conferences, receive an envelope in a shady garage, meet an environmentalist doomer for debate or put sensors on hundreds of Berliner’s bicycles.A reporter can join Ukrainian forces in the trenches, knock on people’s doors because they are affected of policy in some way or the other and they can interview people in power until it hurts.Human reporters’ agency, their ability to access information that was previously unavailable is what I think will set them appart form AI curated information for the next decades. Reporting, the act of gathering information, has always been what made good journalism. It is what young journalists should do exclusively.Emotional anchorsThere is one more aspect that I’m not quite sure about. All forms of outlets, be it media networks such as CNN, FOX, BBC or DW or TikToks, Youtubes, be it influencers or social media journalists, all of them, are filled to the brim with talking heads. People who talk about something, point at something or ask something.They say people like seeing other people. And I personally think that this won’t change. It is absolutely within range of imagination that within the next decade a machine generated “deep-fake” image of a person could read the news, “report” from somewhere in a live “cross” or give an “expert opinion” through funneling data into a model.But I think people like watching reality. They like to see that something could possibly go wrong, they like knowing that the person on screen or in their VR goggles is an actual person. I call this emotional anchors. An audience anchors their emotions in this person on screen. I think people would feel like a computer generated person would feel cheaper than an actual person, even if its impossible to tell them appart. I think market competition will crowd out media outlets that put their bets into a ai-generated person basket. But this is just me rambling.Let me be a reporter already, what I need for thatI think for young journalists there is only hope if we can work as reporters and possibly as emotional anchors. The first thing to note is, that this has probably always been true. If a young journalist too quickly went into editorial roles or too quickly went into roles of news packaging or research, they probably struggled later on to get back into reporter roles.But I think with AI generated content on the rise, this is more true than ever. For young journalists this means, we have two not mutually exclusive options: One is becoming emotional anchors. This pathway means as much on camera or public-facing work as possible. This means building a reputation with a community of your audience. Being the witty one, being funny, being entertaining. This is easier to do in visual journalism than in writing, I think, but it is inherently a very crowded field with thin ways to climb a ladder.The other way is to gear our early careers very clearly onto the gathering of previously unavailable information. This can mean many different paths but I do think they have one thing in common: Asking the right questions in the right way.Most of this is a matter of experience, hence gearing a career towards being a reporter will mean as much doing as possible, as much reporting as possible.Asking the right questions is a matter of education. This will mean specialization of topics, constant education and learning, this will mean asking your employer to go to research seminars, to conferences, to get another degree. I personally don’t think that this will involve too much education on new skills because I believe technology will make access to tools easier (see above).Asking in the right way comes through what I’d call reporter stamina. Being able to not cave in an interview but solicit information. Being able to emotionally connect with a person who is struggling to tell their story. I think this is again a function of experience but I also think that this is something that can be best learned from colleagues. Watch and observe and then ask accordingliy.An AI won’t ever be able to do that."

Juni 1865 marschierte General Gordon Granger in Galveston Bay, Texas ein und setzte so die von Präsident Abraham Lincoln am 1. Januar 1863 erlassene Emazipationsproklamation um, die Sklaverei in den Südstaaten abschaffte.Ich bin am Feiertag zu einer nachmittäglichen Geburtstags-Grillparty eingeladen und konnte  noch am Samstag mit dem Geburtstagskind ausloten, wie die Feinheiten US amerikanischer Kultur sich bei einer solchen sommerlichen Party verhalten: Was bringt man mit? Selbstgemacht oder gekauft? Kartoffelsalat, Oliven, Hummus, Aufbackbaguette? Halumi, Ruccula-Pesto-Nudelsalat, Tupperdosen?Ich höre, es werde einen Grill geben, die Gastgeberin bereitet Burger vor, Schwein, Rind und eine kleine Menge mit Pilzen. Sie versuche zu koordinieren, dass nicht alle nur Chips kaufen.Ich entscheide also, Peach Cobbler zu machen — nicht weil ich weiß, wie das geht, oder was das ist. Aber ich habe davon gehört.Es ist Sonntag, ich ziehe zum Einkaufen los. Die Sonne bruzzelt, ich schwinge mich auf’s Fahrrad. Ich wohne, wie man sagt, »einen Block in Maryland«, einem der zwei an Washington DC angrenzenden Bundestaaten. Es ist ruhig hier, Wohngegend, ein Restaurant, in dem scheinbar jedes Tier fritiert wird, das aus dem Wasser kommt, dazu Pilze frittiert; fantastischer Coleslaw-Salat. Ein 7/11, eine Art Späti/Kiosk-Kette, die manchmal kein Alkohol führt.Und es gibt hier eben zwei Supermärkte, die sich, wie mein Vermieter sagt, insbesondere an die Latino-Community richten. Dort gibt es nicht nur Lebensmittel, die ich noch nie gesehen habe (Hallo frittierte Schweinehaut in Überlebensgröße), sondern auch eine Auswahl, die ich so nicht kannte: Mangos, Papaya, frische Kräuter, Yams und herzhafte Teigwaren auf Maismehlbasis.Ich fahre mit dem Rad zum größeren der beiden Supermärkte, der etwas weiter entfernt ist; an einer zweispurigen Straße entlang auf dem Gehsteig, leicht hügelig. Heute ist wohl eine Art Aktion vor dem Geschäft: Ein Grill, ein paar Pavilions, Bass wummert durch die Luft. Es gibt irgendwie keine Preisschilder, die angeben, was serviert wird. Es riecht allerdings vorzüglich.HeterogenitätWährend der elften Klasse habe ich kleine Teile des  Mittleren Westen der Vereinigten Staaten kennengelernt. Mein Umfeld waren weiße, eher reiche Familien, mit Migrationsgeschichten aus Deutschland, den nordischen Ländern, Irland und Großbritannien. Wir sind manchmal nach Chicago gefahren, ins Museum oder Essen gegangen. Das war meine Erfahrung mit der amerikanischen Stadt. Später bin ich durch Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia und New York gereist.In Washington DC wohne ich nun seit sechs Wochen, gemeinsam mit etwa 671 Tausend Anderen. In der Metropol-Region leben 6,4 Millionen und die Stadt zählt zu den Südstaaten, Weißes Haus und Kapitol sind von Sklaven gebaut. Washington, der »District of Columbia (DC)« ist kein eigentlicher Bundesstaat, sondern unterliegt weitgehend der Kontrolle des Kongresses. Hier fahren Autos, deren Nummernschilder mit dem Spruch »End Taxation without Representation« verziert sind – in Anspielung an das Bonmont der Amerikanischen Revolution. Denn Bürger:innen von Washington DC können zwar den Präsidenten und Stadtvorstehende wählen. Aber der US-Kongress, also Repräsentantenhaus und Senat, hat Befugnisse der Stadtverwaltung gegenüber. Und die Abgeordneten, die DC-Einwohnende dort wählen können, haben als besondere Abgeornete keine Stimmrechte.Mein Airbnb liegt am nördlichen Ende der Stadt. Zu Fuß sind es etwa 25 Minuten nach Fort Totten, der nächsten Metro-Station, einer S-Bahn, die im Stadtzentrum untergrund fährt. In eine Richtung von meinem Zimmer liegt diese Bahnstation, in eine weitere ein gigantischer Park und in die dritte ebenjener Supermarkt mit dem Grill vor der Tür.Demographie: Washington Metropolitan Area (2021)Non-Hispanic White: 43%Black or African American: 24% (including African 5.4%, West Indian 1.2%, and Ethiopian 0.8%[25])Hispanic or Latino: 17%Asian: 11%Mixed and Other: 6%Hispanic Origin \tAsian Origin5.2% Salvadoran \t2.9% Indian2.3% Mexican \t\t1.9% Chinese1.6% Guatemalan \t1.2% Korean1.2% Puerto Rican \t1.2% Vietnamese0.9% Honduran \t\t1.0% Filipino0.9% Peruvian \t\t0.5% Pakistani0.8% Bolivian \t\t0.2% Japanese0.5% Colombian \t\t0.2% Thai0.5% Dominican \t\t0.2% Bangladeshi5.6% Other \t\t1.0% Other &gt;&gt; Quelle: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_metropolitan_area), via Census ReporterBevor ich zum Supermarkt aufgebrochen bin, habe ich mich noch zu Peach Cobbler informiert: Pfirsiche, Zucker, Mehl, Backpulver, Butter, Milch, Salz, Ahornsyrup, Zimt, Vanille.Nun zwischen den Regalen finde ich unter Meterwaren Mais- und Reismehl, Backmischungen für Kuchen, Pfannkuchen und Kuchen, die ich noch nie gesehen habe und daher nicht näher benennen kann, kein Backpulver. An einem der Kühlregale spreche ich eine Angestellte an – ein Unterfangen, das mir hier häufig unangenehm ist, weil ich leider kein Spanisch spreche. Wir haben Glück, eine Kundin hinter mir spricht Englisch und Spanisch, versteht meine Frage und hilft aus. Nach etwas vor und zurück und häufiger Verwendung des Begriffs “Soda” werde ich zu Gang 6 geschickt – wie sich herausstellt eben jener Gang, den ich bereits abgesucht hatte.Zwei weitere Mitarbeitende bestätigen dann, dass leider kein Backpulver vorrätig sei. Nach weiterem Suchen finde ich eine gigantische Packung Hefe und denke mir, ich könnte ja auch mit den Pfirsichen einen Pfirsich-Streußel-Deutschland-Kuchen backen. Aber ja, ganz vergessen, ich bin in den USA: Mehl ist unberechenbar, alle Mehlsorten hier im Geschäft haben Backpulver bereits reingemischt. Mehl Inhaltsstoffe: Weizenmehl, Niacin, Eisen, Thiamine Mononitrate, Riboflavin, Folic Acid, Salz, Monocalcium Phosphat, Backpulver.Ich beschließe beim Cobbler zu bleiben und auf das reingemischte Backpulver zu vertrauen.Beim Verlassen des Ladens bekomme ich einen Bon, die Angestellte erklärt: Da draußen, Grill, Tacos.Der Grill, der ein kompletter Autoanhänger zu sein scheint, schmachtet mit riesigen Stakes. Als ich an der Reihe bin, werde ich aufgerufen »Salsa?!«, noch etwas weiteres, das ich nicht verstehe. Die Tacos schmecken fantastisch.TrumpAuf Twitter hat User @Mehdi_IR_DC gepostet:  DC Wetter:      von 6:00 Uhr morgens bis Mittags = San Diego    von Mittags bis Mitternacht = Miami  Am Samstag vor acht Tagen kam die Nachricht: Schickt Janelle und Mathis nach Miami. Donald Trump muss dort vor Gericht erscheinen. Mathis macht Kamera, Janelle berichtet von dort. Montag mittags saßen wir schon in Miami bei venezuelanischem Essen als wir Nachricht bekamen, dass wir für den morgigen Drehtag einen Personenschützer bekämen. Das Trump-Lager hatte Proteste angekündigt.Den Dienstag über stehen wir vor dem Gerichtsgebäude in dem Trump erscheinen soll, umgeben von Presse aus der ganzen Welt – und ab Mittag von Personen, die Trump befreit sehen wollen. »Das Gleiche sei in ihrer Heimat in Honduras passiert.«, »Sie sei aus Cuba und da sei es auch so gekommen«, »Sie sperren die besten Politiker einfach weg, damit sie nicht gegen sie kandidieren können!«Nach seiner Anhörung trifft sich Trump mit Fans in einem Kubanischen Restaurant. Sie besingen ihn zum 77. Geburtstag; er sagte wohl »Essen für alle« und zog nach zehn Minuten ohne etwas bestellt oder bezahlt zu haben wieder ab.Peach CobblerZuhause angekommen, finde ich in einem Schrank Backpulver. Wir wohnen zu viert in einem zweigeschossigen Haus: Der Vermieter, noch zwei weitere Kurzfristmieter. Der Vermieter arbeitet seit 20 Jahren für das Bildungsministerium, fährt in den frühen Morgenstunden für Uber als Teilzeittaxifahrer, hat einen Nebenjob als Wohnungsmakler und vermietet drei Zimmer in seinem Haus.Er hatte mich darauf hingewiesen, dass ich mein Fahrrad bitte nicht über den Vorgarten schieben solle, das würde unschöne Spuren im gepflegten Rasen hinterlassen.Ich bin sparsamer beim Zucker, als das Peach Cobbler Rezept es vorgibt und bereite gleich zwei Portinen vor – damit ich probieren kann, was ich zur Geburtstagsparty mitbringe.Der eine Untermieter lobt die Säure der Pfirsiche, die mit der Süße des Teiges kollidiere.Der Vermieter nimmt sich nach."

    "content": "I don’t know TV. I read, mostly and I listen to audio. In the past, I took fotos with an 1936 camera. This concludes 6 weeks of TV training: Camera, Cutting, Speaking - and watch out for music.I don’t know TVMy media intake is largely text based. Linear TV, webvideo, social - I know them, I sometimes see them, but ever since I don’t own a TV anymore they’re not my go to media.I do enjoy watching the occasional TV series and films. I used to be a Tagesschau junkie but TV always seemed quite far away.So great I had three months of TV.Some storiesIt started out with a month of training which resulted in me going live from a coal vessle in the Rhine and an accompanying report.It continued with me interning at DW’s Sports News Desk in Berlin, with me running between the newsroom, the studio, meeting cutters, voicing videos and actually going shooting with camerapeople.And it ended with a two week intensive on shooting ourselfes: Handling storytelling, interviewing, camera, sound, post-production all as a one-person team and for me several super sweet encounters.For one task during the seminar my colleague Julett and I stumbled into a local darts bar and with no preparation but permission just started shooting with one of the younger players in the tournament that night. Just before entering the place, Julett hat told me of her friend Ana who had said “As a journalist, don’t be the fly on the wall, be the elephant in the room.” Well, entering a local one-room bar that has no music playing but highly concentrated darts players and some loners at the bar carrying a huge camcorder bearing a fat DW logo - we were the big ass elephant in the room. Which, I would say in the end played nicely in our favour. Because the camera was already there. They knew something may be coming but asking if we could just get a beer did buy some time for mutual reassurance and calmity of everyones minds. The shots there turned out beautifully. Thanks to Beul’s eye.I got to shoot at the Bonn Botanical Gardens a week later. I focus-pulled my way through damp greenhouses which gave the camera some headache and overexposed maybe 20 percent of my material. But the huge learning was that I picked out music for the piece before I went shooting. Just to set the vibe I was aiming for. Its a problematic strategy because maybe what you find on-site isn’t what you were aiming for with your music. So, staying open to the place is a must.Some takeaways  Storytelling          Action first, Meta later      Emotion early, Background later      For no-narration pieces plan questions ahead of time        Planning a shoot          Rule of thumb: One scene per minute film-time      Plan for questions per scene      Master Interview and/or situational questions?      Think of all the Schnittbilder you are going to need. Make a list.      Plan for breaks and snacks        Interviews          Emotional questions: How does it feel, Whats your favorite      Set multiple interviewees on opposing sides of the frame      If interviewee is on left side, try to ask questions from right side of camera to have them looking into the frame        Camera          Five-Shot rule (see matrix below)      Change shot angle by 30 degrees for each shot      Shoot neutral transitions      Stabilize camera when zooming      Use zebra to aviod overexposure        Editing          Change shot size each cut and consider skipping one size (see figure below)                  Don’t cut head on head          You can go anywhere from a Detail                    Keep checking for Schwarzbilder      Hide your mistakes in the edits                  Sometimes changing speed/direction does the trick          Adjustment layers do wonders for color-correction of interview settings                    Keep going to a neutral picture      Sound                  Level SOTs to approx. - 6db          Level Music/Ambience to approx. -12/-18 db                      Voicing/Narration          Keep narration to a minimum      Cranck up your voice for the narration. You don’t want to sound sleepy.      Be to the point and work with the pictures      “Touch and go”: Talk about we see first and take it from there somewhere else.        PTC          Chill out. You have time and everything is good.      The more chill you are the more surgically you can use your hands.      Make three, max four points per PTC/live-answer      Use your background wisely      Bring cable headphones. Just less drama.            "

    "content": "Sieht man vom nördlichen Ende der fast rechteckigen Fläche von Auschwitz-Birkenau, dem Lager Auschwitz II, über die weitläufige Fläche, hinter den Horizont der gegenüberliegenden Zaunanlage, dann erkennt man dahinter, 80 Kilometer entfernt, Berge.Die Stallanlagen, in die hunderte von Menschen zum nächtigen gepfercht wurden, stehen nicht mehr. Nur Kamingerippe ragen in Reih und Glied aus dem Boden; dann vor diesem gegenüberliegenden Grenzzaun noch einige Backsteinbaraken des ehemaligen Frauenlagers.Es beginnt zu nieseln und an diesen zwei Tagen kann ich mich einige Male zusammenreißen, nicht zu klagen, müde zu sein, nass zu sein, Richtung Hunger zu schielen.Michal führt uns an zwei Tagen, erst durch das Museum von Auschwitz I, dann über die weitläufige Fläche von Birkenau.Michal hört kaum auf zu sprechen. Wir hängen dennoch an jedem Wort. Worte, die Geschichte vermitteln, „Fakten“, wie er sagt, „nicht Emotionen“. Und immer wieder zeigt er auf Fotos von Ermordeten, erzählt von Begegnungen mit Überlebenden: „Wir müssen verstehen, dass das Menschen sind, die ein Leben hatten, so wie wir auch.“Nur noch eine Gaskammer und damit verbundenes Krematorium sind in Auschwitz-Birkenau vollständig. Mich trifft die metallene Anlage, extra dazu gebaut, um Leichnamen ins Krematorium schieben zu können.Im Lager Auschwitz I wurden ehemalige Kasernengebäude zur Internierung verwendet. In diesen Gebäuden sind nun Ausstellungen zu sehen. Eines ist für Studiengruppen unrenoviert zu besichtigen. In dessen Treppenhaus ist der Teil der Wand bis Schulterhöhe in rot-braun abgesetzt. Darüber zeichnet ein gelb-rotes Muster die Mauer und ich frage mich, ob das Treppenhaus schön ist.Da ist ein anderes Gebäude mit den berühmt gewordenen Ausstellungen von Habseligkeiten; Schuhe, die so aussehen, als wären sie gerade noch getragen worden, Koffer, Kochschüsseln. Haufen an Schuhen, Koffern und Kochschüsseln. Dort sind auch die Berge rasierter Haare ausgestellt. Berge, die einmal um den Raum herum reichen, die sich auftürmen und nach Befreiung des Lagers in Säcken gefunden wurden, bereit zur Weiterverarbeitung versendet zu werden. Berge von Haaren, die von mutmaßlich 40 000 Ermordeten stammen. Mich trifft besonders die Ausstellung der Prothesen, Gehhilfen; Ein Wirrwarr getragener Extremitäten, an Stützen eines Lebens. Viele dieser ausgestellten Dinge wurden Juden gestohlen, die im ersten Weltkrieg fürs Kaiserreich gekämpft hatten.Wir treffen Teresa Wontor-Cichy für einen Vortrag über die in Auschwitz-Birkenau verfolgten und ermordeten Sinti und Roma, und Zeugen Jehova. Sie berichtet von der Härte ihrer Arbeit, der Schwere der Dinge, die sie jeden Tag liest und sieht. Die Historikerin sagt, es sei ein Balanceakt nach Hoffnung zu suchen und nicht zu beschönigen.Wontor-Cichy ist eine hagere Frau, ernst. Eigentlich müssen wir los zum letzten Bus nach Krakau. Aber sie möchte uns noch von denjenigen in Auschwitz-Birkenau berichten, die die Nazis hierher wegen Homosexualität deportierten - meist, nachdem Partner sie verpfiffen hatten. Sie fragt: „Haben wir Zeit für noch eine Gruppe?“ Wie sollen wir keine Zeit haben?Am nächsten Tag treffen wir Paweł Sawicki, den Leiter der Öffentlichkeitsarbeit der Gedenkstätte Auschwitz, der auf Social-Media jeden Tag 12 Menschen an deren Geburtstag gedenkt, die in Auschwitz-Birkenau inhaftiert waren oder ermordet wurden. Paweł hat eigentlich gerade Urlaub. Aber es ist ihm wichtig, mit einer Gruppe junger Journalist:innen zu sprechen.Früher, sagt Paweł, hatten sie in der Gedenkstätte das Ziel, zu erinnern. Seit einigen Jahren reicht ihnen das nicht mehr. Jetzt wollen sie in öffentliche Diskussionen eingreifen. Wie damals als sie einer Schule eine Ausstellung schickten, nachdem ein Foto im Internet viral ging, auf dem etwa 50 Jungs den Hitlergruß zeigten. Und sie rufen Besucher:innen jetzt auch direkt zu Zivilcourage auf. Dazu, nicht daneben zu stehen und zuzusehen, wenn etwas passiert.Immer wieder kommt die Frage auf, wer was wann gewusst hat. Paweł ist skeptisch ob der Relevanz der Frage. Der polnische Widerstand habe Unterstützungsanfragen aus dem Lagerwiderstand abgewiesen, wegen der Deutschen Übermacht. Erst 1944 hätten die USA das Lager von Italien aus mit Flugzeugen überfliegen können. Und Paweł verweist auf Lager von heute.In einigen Monaten beginnt die Gedenkstätte den Versuch, virtuelle Führungen anzubieten, bei denen übers Internet vernetzt live von vor Ort aus geführt wird.Sie versuchen alles, um die Erinnerung wach zu halten. Paweł rechnet nicht mit den Millionen Besucher:innen, die die Gedenkstätte besucht haben. Sondern mit den Millionen, die sie noch nicht besucht haben.Es hat bis zum Flugzeug gedauert, um diese Erlebnisse aufzuschreiben. Mit Blick auf die Wolken und die untergehende Sonne vergeht der Flug wie im Flug. Auschwitz bleibt näher als ich dachte."

Or hell, just ask people what they like around their community.Its nice to…  let readers come to their own conclusions  show possibilities with nuance  let experts make judgements  offer options or comparisons  be rigorous in critique  Use comparisons well (Don’t use a very short wikipedia entry from 2001 as evidence that Wikipedia is biased. There just wasn’t much Wikipedia then.)4 pillarsTo bring something like a methodology or rigor, use these 4 pillars that should find space in your solutions story. No matter how brief you keep it (errrr looking at you social media attention grabs).  Solution          For yourself, be clear about the problem at hand      Explain one solution to this specific problem      »This is cool and achieved this…«        Insights          How did they actually achieve this thing?      Describe the steps so it is actually possible to reproduce this solution        Evidence          What is the evidence for success of this solution      Best use solutions that already yield evidence / are proven      Is there studies that support the evidence?      Does the evidence match the problem at hand or something else?        Limitations          »Does it work for everyone?«      »Is there enough money to do it elsewhere/everywhere?«      These are the critical journalistic steps of rigour      Use this to avoid writing a hero-story      "

    "content": "One week of podcast and social training. A podcast on gender stereotypes in fairy tales, one on female political crime, and one on biases in global tech. Some TikTok socials that took a planet money approach. These approaches go into the direction of acting, political-journalistic theater (a thing to explore in itself probably).Main takeaway: Either do an interview podcast. If you’re super niche this may work out of the box. Or do a feature-like podcast and spend shitloads of time on scripting. Or do something else.Podcast Research Takeaways  Having a good host (their voice) is great          Use voice modulation wisely      Think about format: Interview, Feature, Expolration, Kollegengespräch, Panel, w/o host      Podcasts tend to a niche. So be niche.      Laid back narrations let the story shine      Be well prepared. With political formats take extra care with research to avoid being criticized for bias.        Scripting well allows to build drama/tension          Focus well      Structure is key otherwise listeners get lost      Starting in the middle is great but don’t be confusing                  Be sure to raise suspense          Starting with something people know situates them easily, then spin it into your direction (e.g. Use a well known TV show, then spin towards where you want to go with a bang)          Introduce the Fallhöhe early, then circle back to what you’d like to say                    Create a takeaway list before scripting, then use it to structure      Repeat stuff if its important      Answer clearly: »Why should I listen to this?«   \t- Raise questions but answer them                  Be clear about the aim and state it          Keep audience hooked: Cliffhangers throughout?                    Structure with music, use music to separate different pieces of content      Continuous pieces are super dense. Keep in mind to take the listener by the hand and possibly give them a break      Original elements early are nice to show you’re adding value        Feel &amp; Vibes          World-building is great but doesn’t work for every format      How social is it?      Be entertaining      Atmo is generally nice but you can get away without it. It may sound overengineered      Collage of news-soundbites always work      Visual language is key (like with radio)      Fake atmo is tricky: It may create the desired effect but may also get called out      Podcast Feedback Criteria  Audience          Podcast for niche?      Hook: Why should they listen?      Keeping hooked      Visual language      Atmo: Are we »in the room«?      Do focus and audience actually match?        Structure          Clear title &amp; teaser      Adds feeling with music      Emotional insight?      Intriguing, clear script      Was I ever lost while listening?      Did you state the aim clearly?      Clear focus?      Smart storytelling? Is there enough meat on the bone?      Strong soundbites from interviews?        Host          Connects with audience      Creates atmosphere      Sets up a space to narrate      Uses voice modulation well      "

    "content": "The internet is full of explainers exploring topics ranging from US  foreign policy agenda on Taiwan, the New York subway system, to why Helms Deep is the best cinematographic battle ever filmed.So, what are some of the nuts and bolts on making such an explainer?We focussed on video-formats. However, many of these guidelines may be applicable to other journalistic formats as well.Content StrategyFocus on either of:  SEO, push on search words, amounts of uploads, optimize keywords only but keep content broad  Clickability, niché content, innovation, technically smaller crowd but potentially larger impact  Steal as much as possible          Use what helps you, discard what is shitty.      Be structured about it: Keep a diary with inspiration; Make gifs as previews of what works so you can easily check on what you need once you need something        People like people not corporations: Social media is personalKinds of Explainers  Straight/News: On one concept thats on the news right now, give it a spin and context  Entertainment: Answer irresistable questions, mythbusting (inspiration from explain like I’m five), referr to different levels of difficulty.  Boundary between video essays and explainers is blurry; the former may have more of an argument the latter may be more exploratoryHow to StructureKeep it as simple as possible. Kill all darlings and just do one thing well:  “Every successful piece of nonfiction should leave the reader with one provocative thought that he or she didn’t have before. Not two thoughts, or five - just one. So decide what single point you want to leave in the reader’s mind.” — William Zinsser, On Writing WellVox has done a lot in this field. Especially,Johnny Harris’ formula can act as a great inspiration.  Keep saying “this is a map/box/border/glass of water/pessimist…”          It contradicts show don’t tell but adds humourous elements      I personally think this is a trend and will change in time        A generally working outline is:          Pre-titles (hooky start, summary, setting stakes)      Titles      Background      Answer to posed Question      Reflection      Endings      Come back to beginning      What does it mean?      Constructive: What can we do about it?        Make sure visuals match narration because visuals always win  See-saw between visuals and narration on which is doing heavy lifting: Write with two hands (one visual, one narration)          If one hand is calm, the other can be complicated      Create a rythm between visuals and narration (also see Johnny Harris’ formula)      Write visuals and narration always side by side, think visual-first; If you do it in a table: go back to start if the visual column is empty        Hand-off between narration and quotaion or even repeat (humourous)  Add humor  Give experience first, explanation second          Anchor the eye on an image      Tell something about the image that the viewer can’t see      Give context to the picture        Long videos: Think about adding a B-Roll, side-story  Offer a visual break: Throw in calmness throughout the video to give viewers a f#&amp;ing breakHow to explain  Do you have authority yourself (experts, self-taught, does your position matter?)  Bring in experts to do heavy lifting or text reference, show your research, don’t shy away from saying “I’m just learning here” (personally, again I think this is a trend that will wane)  Write down three approaches, see which one carries best  Bulldoze your approach, then kill darlings, then remix, then build anew  Write active voice only  Do the suspense-test          Do you want to know what happens next if you pause the video at any moment?      Think about this happens but this happens therefore this happens      How to write  Research visual evidence  Write visually  Do your research well  Use Atmo, let the viewer hear what the place sounds like  Homework on screen: Place a chart on your screen and say something very simple about it. The viewer will do the rest  Show the abstract: Suitcases for migration, cutting hair on the border for poverty, stuff made of money for inflationHow to title  Be more click-baity than you’d think, your editor can correct  Use mystery-formulas, bite-words that signal “hidden truth, real reason, etc.”  Create friction/tension in the title that makes it intriguing  Write down a list of 25 titles, really write this list  Make sure your pretitles are sound: The first seconds of a video are what counts, raise the stakes, foreshadow, be on point between narration and visuals, be visual, but most importantly: don’t oversell."

    "content": "Für Beratungen zur Unterstützung der Ukraine hatte US-Verteidigungsminister Lloyd Austin auf die Militärbasis Ramstein eingeladen. Was ist das für ein Ort und was hat das Bundesverfassungsgericht damit zu tun?» DW: Original ArtikelAktuelles Stichwort  Auslieferung: Deutsch  Adaptionen: Arabisch, Spanisch, Brasilianisch, BulgarischFür manche sind es die USA im Taschenformat, für andere ist es der Dreh- und Angelpunkt des weltweiten US-amerikanischen Drohnenkriegs. Seit Jahren polarisiert der Militärstützpunkt Ramstein in Deutschland.Am Dienstag hatte US-Verteidigungsminister Llyod Austin Vertreter von 40 Staaten auf die Ramstein Air Base in Deutschland eingeladen, um über den Krieg in der Ukraine zu beraten. Deutschland sagte im Rahmen des Treffens zu, schwere Waffen an Kiew zu liefern. Was sollte man über Ramstein wissen?Seit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs gehören an vielen Orten in Deutschland US-Truppen zum Stadtbild. Der Standort Ramstein ist einer von über 20 US-Militärbasen in der Bundesrepublik, gilt jedoch als wichtigster europäischer Stützpunkt für den Lufttransport der US-Streitkräfte. Auch Streitkräfte anderer Staaten haben Truppen in Deutschland stationiert.Im Zweiten Weltkrieg nutzte die deutsche Luftwaffe ein Stück der Reichsautobahn zwischen Saarbrücken und Kaiserslautern für Notlandungen. US-Truppen nahmen den Behelfsflugplatz in der Nähe zu Frankreich gegen Kriegsende ein und bauten die Stelle ab 1951 zu einer Militärbasis aus. Seit 1954 regelt ein völkerrechtlicher Vertrag den Aufenthalt ausländischer Streitkräfte in Deutschland.Little AmericaAls Transportflugplatz dient die Ramstein Air Base heute als Logistikdrehkreuz für die US-Streitkräfte. Bei der Evakuierung aus Afghanistan im Sommer 2021 wurden etwa 7000 Menschen nach Ramstein ausgeflogen. Neben dem Flugplatz sind auch Hauptquartiere der US Air Force in Europa und Afrika sowie weitere Koordinierungsstellen auf dem Stützpunkt untergebracht.Die Militärbasis im Südwesten Deutschlands misst 14 Quadratkilometer und beschäftigt über 9000 US-Soldatinnen und Soldaten. In der Region sind etliche weitere Kasernen, Munitionsdepots und medizinische Einrichtungen angesiedelt, mit dem Landstuhl Regional Medical Center auch das größte Lazarett der US Army außerhalb der USA.Die Gegend bildet somit die “Kaiserslautern Military Community”. Dort leben nach US-Angaben etwa 53.000 US-Amerikaner, die in eigenen Shopping-Malls, High Schools und Bowlingbahnen in einem Little America leben können. Die Community ist damit auch ein wichtiger Wirtschaftsfaktor: als größter Arbeitgeber in der Region und mit einem erheblichen Beitrag zum lokalen Wirtschaftswachstum.Offiziell gilt deutsches Recht, aber mit EinschränkungenIn den vergangenen Jahren entbrannte in Deutschland eine Diskussion über die rechtliche Stellung von Ramstein. Ausländische Militärliegenschaften gelten in Deutschland nicht als extraterritoriales Gebiet. Somit gilt dort eigentlich deutsches Recht.Aber das US-Militär genießt eine gewisse Immunität und Sonderrechte: Deutsche Behörden dürfen nur mit US-amerikanischer Erlaubnis auf die Basis und die USA üben selbst Strafgerichtsbarkeit bei Vergehen auf dem Stützpunkt aus.Der Wissenschaftliche Dienst des Bundestags kam 2017 zum Schluss, dass “eine Sanktionierung von Straftaten, welche möglicherweise auf dem Stützpunkt Ramstein begangen werden könnten, durch deutsche Behörden schwierig” sei. Eine einseitige Kündigung der Stationierung durch die Bundesrepublik sei zwar rechtlich möglich, jedoch “politisch nicht gangbar”, so der Bericht.Drohnenkrieg von Deutschland aus?Tatsächlich gab es in den vergangenen Jahren immer wieder Bestrebungen deutscher Behörden genauer auszuleuchten, was in Ramstein passiert. Offiziell erklärten Regierungsvertreter lange Jahre, dazu lägen ihnen keine Erkenntnisse vor.Seit 2013 berichten Medien in Deutschland immer wieder darüber, welche Rolle die Ramstein Airbase im weltweiten Drohnenkrieg der Vereinigten Staaten spielt.Zwischen 2004 und 2020 kamen bei über 14.000 US-Drohnenangriffen zwischen 910 und 2200 Zivilisten ums Leben, das berichtete das Bureau of Investigative Journalism in London. Das US-Militär hat mit Drohnen Ziele in Irak, Afghanistan, Jemen, Pakistan und Somalia angegriffen.Der frühere US-Drohnenpilot Brandon Bryant sagte 2015 vor dem NSA-Untersuchungsauschuss des Deutschen Bundestags aus, Ramstein sei “die zentrale Relaisstation” für die Tötungsmissionen gewesen: Die über einem Einsatzgebiet kreisenden Drohnen kommunizierten via Satelliten mit dem Stützpunkt in Deutschland. Dort werde das Signal verstärkt und per Glasfaserkabel in die USA geschickt. Von Endpunkten in den USA aus würden Ziele markiert und tödliche Raketen oder Drohnen ausgelöst.Im Jahr 2016 räumt die US-Regierung ein, dass Ramstein nicht nur zur Weitergabe der Daten verwendet wird: Militärs und Geheimdienstmitarbeiter auf dem Stützpunkt in Deutschland wirkten auch bei der Planung, Überwachung und Auswertung von Angriffen mit.Klage von jemenitischen ÜberlebendenJemenitische Überlebende eines Drohnenangriffs hatten 2014 gegen die Bundesregierung geklagt. Sie forderten die Bundesrepublik auf sicherzustellen, dass deutsches Bundesgebiet nicht für völkerrechtswidrige Angriffe genutzt werde. Die drei Männer aus dem Jemen hatten 2012 bei einem Angriff Angehörige verloren.2019 hatte das Oberverwaltungsgericht Münster entschieden, dass die Bundesrepublik sich vergewissern müsse, ob die Vereinigten Staaten die Ramstein Air Base im Einklang mit dem Völkerrecht nutzen.Das Verteidigungsministerium legte jedoch Revision gegen das Urteil ein und das Bundesverwaltungsgericht kassierte die Entscheidung aus Münster ein Jahr später. Es reiche nicht aus, dass Ramstein technisch das Drohnenprogramm ermögliche. Auf deutschem Boden müssten konkrete Entscheidungen getroffen werden, so das Gericht.Im Jahr 2021 legten die jemenitischen Kläger, unterstützt durch das European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, Beschwerde beim Bundesverfassungsgericht ein, dem höchsten deutschen Gericht. Sie pochen darauf, dass die Bundesrepublik völkerrechtswidrige Handlungen auf deutschem Territorium unterbinden muss."

    "content": "German leaders recently agreed on a €2 billion package helping states accommodate and integrate Ukrainian refugees fleeing Russia’s war. But money is not the only problem.» DW: Original ArtikelHintergrund  Auslieferung: Deutsch, EnglischSankt Augustin is maxed out. That’s how the mayor of the small city near Bonn, Max Leitterstorf, puts it.  It has taken in 343 people from Ukraine since the beginning of March, but in the long run, the mayor will run out of money to provide shelter or food. Many cities and communities in Germany are facing a similar problem.Leaders of Germany’s 16 states and the federal government agreed last week on a cost-sharing mechanism. Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that the federal government would provide €2 billion ($2.17 billion) in support to Germany’s states for accommodating and integrating Ukrainian refugees.In addition, refugees from Ukraine will in future receive support through the “Hartz IV” welfare program, which provides a basic safety net for those out of work. The decision means that refugees receive slightly more direct financial benefits than with the previous scheme — and it relieves the budget of cities like Sankt Augustin.“The agreement is a good basis for our country to stand together in the long term,” Scholz said, after meeting state-level leaders.“Overall, we have found an acceptable compromise on the distribution of financial responsibility,” said Hendrik Wüst, premier of Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, after the agreement was announced.The exception of German federalism: ‘unclear responsibilities’On March 4, the European Union granted refugees from Ukraine sweeping admission — but in Germany, it is the individual municipalities that have been footing the bill so far.The country’s political system of federalism complicates cost-sharing.The federal government and the states have separate responsibilities. When it comes to schools and universities, for example, the 16 German states don’t like federal interference.However, with last week’s decision, the federal government will chip in with the costs for schooling Ukrainian children.“That the federal government supplies funding is more and more common because it has larger financial resources,” says Dietrich Thränhardt, a researcher specializing in political systems and migration. But in such circumstances the “thicket of competencies and unclear responsibilities gets denser and basically the public doesn’t know who is responsible,” says the professor emeritus at Münster University.The funding decisions in detailRefugees from Ukraine can enter Germany without a visa. For refugees who register, municipalities have so far paid for medical bills and welfare.This is set to change on June 1. As of that date, refugees from Ukraine will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act but will be entitled to assistance in accordance with Social Code II (SGB II) — typically called Hartz IV.This is an important change. Instead of €367 monthly, singles are then entitled to €449 a month, as well as statutory health insurance, and immediate access to the labor market.Most of all, the rule change relieves budgets of local authorities and federal states. This is because benefits under the Hartz IV system are paid almost entirely by the federal government. In the previous model, the states and municipalities picked up the tab.In addition, the federal government will give the states a one-time boost of €2 billion, €500 million of which is supposed to cover the costs incurred to date. Another €500 million is earmarked to pay for accommodation in the coming months. And the remaining €1 billion is to help with schooling and daycare centers.The agreement will be reassessed in November in view of the course of the war in Ukraine.A step in the ‘right direction’Gesine Lötzsch, deputy chair of the Left Party, says with an eye on the deal: “It is a step in the right direction.” But according to the far-left politician, the new arrangement creates a system of first- and second-class refugees.Those who have been applying for asylum in Germany for years will receive worse benefits than Ukrainians. In addition, many people from “African countries have studied in Ukraine and they, too, of course, are fleeing this terrible criminal war, but they do not have the same protection as people who have Ukrainian passports,” Lötzsch says.Another blank spot remains after Thursday’s meeting: In the run-up, municipalities had called for support in registering refugees. The federal-state roundtable remained vague on the subject.What are the costs in the long term?Germany has registered around 316,000 Ukrainian refugees so far, according to federal police. Berlin estimates that up to 60,000 Ukrainian refugees are currently residing in the German capital. But the number may be higher, given the uncertainty surrounding registration procedures and the fact that Ukrainian nationals have the legal right to enter the country without a visa.With headcounts unclear, it is difficult to estimate what costs Germany will incur in the long term for aiding refugees.In 2015 and 2016 over 1 million people fled to Germany, especially from war-torn Syria. Since then, the German government estimated costs of about €1,000 per refugee, per month.Today, however, things are different: Ukrainians who have fled do not have to go through lengthy asylum procedures and are allowed to work directly. Thus, social welfare will be cheaper. But there will be long-term costs, for example, in integrating refugees into the labor market or into schools.In Sankt Augustin, the small city in western Germany, there are still free beds for refugees. This is because capacities for accommodation were created in 2015/16, says mayor Max Leitterstorf.  But soon, refugees from Ukraine who are currently accommodated in private homes will probably need these beds.Leitterstorf doesn’t care when he will be reimbursed for aiding refugees. He would help even if no money came at all. But one problem remains: Many municipalities simply don’t have enough staff to handle refugee aid in addition to their ordinary tasks. So, in Sankt Augustin, as in many other places, there is a backlog on many public services as workers struggle to cope.*This article was originally written in German."

Experten warnen: Vor allem bei Bildung und Arbeitsmarktintegration könnte es Probleme geben.» DW: Original ArtikelHintergrund  Auslieferung: Deutsch  Adaptionen: Ukrainisch, Mazedonisch, Russisch, Spanisch, Kroatisch, Serbisch, BosnischIhor Bielozorov will arbeiten. Der ukrainische Zahnarzt war im Urlaub, als er vom Krieg in seiner Heimat überrascht wurde. Um nicht ewig bei seinen Bekannten in der Nähe von Osnabrück im Nordwesten Deutschlands zu Gast zu sein, sucht er schnell ein eigenes Einkommen. Doch so einfach ist das nicht.Am Mittwoch besprach sich Bundesarbeitsminister Hubertus Heil, wie Geflüchtete aus der Ukraine in den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt finden können. Die Zeichen dafür stehen eigentlich gut, denn das Bildungsniveau in der Ukraine gilt als hoch im internationalen Vergleich.Etwa 280.000 Geflüchtete aus der Ukraine wurden seit Kriegsbeginn in Deutschland registriert. Entsprechend einer neuen EU-Richtlinie dürfen sie sofort in Deutschland arbeiten.Integration scheitert an Anerkennung von AbschlüssenEs ist vor allem das deutsche Anerkennungsverfahren für ausländische Berufsabschlüsse, das Ihor Bielozorov bisher von einer Arbeit in seinem erlernten Beruf abhält. Ein bis zwei Jahre, berichten ihm Bekannte, wird es dauern, bis er in Deutschland offiziell als Zahnarzt arbeiten kann. Bis dahin muss er neben einer Sprach- auch eine Fachprüfung ablegen, obwohl Bielozorov in der Ukraine bereits zwei Jahre als Zahnarzt gearbeitet hat.»Die Anerkennungsverfahren sind teuer, langwierig und komplex«, sagt Martina Müller-Wacker im DW-Gespräch. Die Expertin für Berufsintegration fordert daher, dass der Bund die Verfahren kostenlos anbietet und mit einem Stipendium die häufig nötigen Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen fördert. Denn oft versuchen Migrantinnen und Migranten wegen der hohen Hürden erst gar nicht, die Anerkennung zu bekommen, und bleiben in schlechter bezahlten Jobs.Deutschland | Ankunft ukrainischer Flüchtlinge in BerlinZum Verhängnis wird vor allem die Komplexität der Verfahren. Laut Müller-Wacker sind etwa 1500 unterschiedliche Stellen in Deutschland für Berufsanerkennung zuständig, Bundes- und Landesrecht unterscheidet sich mitunter, und Behörden sind überfordert. Es gibt Berufe, für die eine Anerkennung notwendig ist, und welche, die keine offizielle Zulassung brauchen. Das Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung empfiehlt Betroffenen eine Broschüre, die auch in ukrainischer Sprache vorliegt.Wer im Ausland einen Beruf erlernt hat, muss zur Anerkennung oft ordnerweise Unterlagen einreichen: Zeugnisse, Studienlisten und Gutachten. Müller-Wacker schlägt daher vor, auf Bundesebene zu deckeln, welche Unterlagen gefordert werden können.Nach dem Gespräch von Bundesarbeitsminister Hubertus Heil mit Spitzenvertretern von Arbeitgeber, Wirtschafts- und Sozialverbänden sowie Gewerkschaften nannte der SPD-Politiker die Anerkennung ausländischer Abschlüsse eine “Herkulesaufgabe”.Die Vereinfachung des Arbeitsmarktzugangs für Ausländer ist im Ampel-Koalitionsvertrag vorgesehen. Nach dem Termin am Mittwoch verwies Heil auf weitere Treffen, gab aber keine konkreten Entscheidungen bekannt.In den vergangenen zwei Jahren hat das bundesweite Programm “Integration durch Qualifizierung” (IQ) fast 5000 Ukrainer bei Anerkennungsverfahren beraten; am häufigsten Lehrerinnen. Für sie sind die Hürden jedoch besonders hoch. Denn Bayern lässt Lehrerinnen aus Nicht-EU-Staaten gar nicht zu, in den meisten Bundesländern müssen die Pädagogen ein Referendariat nachholen und häufig nebenbei ein zweites Fach studieren. Aber Expertin Müller-Wacker hat einen Rat: “In Hamburg können Lehrerinnen auch nur mit einem vertieften Fach in den Schuldienst.”Schulen und Kitas schon jetzt am LimitÜberhaupt, der Bildungsbereich. Gut die Hälfte der Geflüchteten aus der Ukraine sind Kinder. Aber: “Fast in allen Bundesländern fehlen Lehrerinnen und Gebäude”, sagt Juliane Karakayali von der Evangelischen Hochschule Berlin.Karakayali ist skeptisch, ob die Integration in den Schulen gelingen wird. Schulen und Kitas seien schlecht vorbereitet.Wichtig ist der Professorin für Soziologie, geflüchtete Kinder nicht separiert zu unterrichten. Denn so fehle den Kindern der Anschluss, um Deutsch zu lernen. Die Gefahr sei, dass Kinder es dann langfristig schwerer am Arbeitsmarkt haben.Der rechtliche Anspruch auf Schulbesuch ist in den Bundesländern unterschiedlich geregelt. Laut Karakayali haben Kinder in Berlin bereits ab dem Tag ihrer Ankunft das Recht auf einen Schulplatz; in Nordrhein-Westfalen und Bayern hänge das vom Aufenthaltsstatus ab und könne auch bis zu sechs Monate dauern. Entscheidend für die Zukunft Geflüchteter aus der Ukraine ist also, wo genau in Deutschland sie landen.Hingehen, wo es Jobs gibtIhor Bielozorov will mit seiner Freundin Oksana dahin in Deutschland ziehen, wo er leicht Arbeit findet. Die Geflüchteten aus der Ukraine, die keine Ersparnisse und keine Kontakte haben, können sich ihren Wohnort jedoch nicht aussuchen.Ihre Verteilung erfolgt deutschlandweit durch den sogenannten Königsteiner Schlüssel. Demnach müssen die bevölkerungsreichen Bundesländer die meisten Menschen aufnehmen.Die Länder wiederum verteilen intern in der Regel in solche Kommunen, die Platz haben. Herbert Brücker vom Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB) warnt daher, dass Geflüchtete häufig in strukturschwache Regionen gebracht werden. Dort stehen zwar oft Wohnungen leer, aber es gibt keine Jobs. Die Erfahrung der vergangenen Jahre hat laut IAB gezeigt, dass Geflüchtete, die ihren Wohnort selbst wählen konnten, eher Arbeit finden.Die Privaten sind flexiblerUnterdessen schießen private Initiativen aus dem Boden, um Geflüchtete aus der Ukraine in Arbeit zu bringen. Internet-Portale wie UATalents oder Imagine Ukraine sind Jobbörsen für alle Berufszweige; die Deutsche Bahn schaltet eine Telefon-Hotline in russischer und ukrainischer Sprache zur Jobvermittlung.Bei allem Aufwand um die Integration bleibt offen, ob die Menschen aus der Ukraine hierbleiben werden, ob sich also die langwierige Anerkennung von Abschlüssen und die Mühen lohnen. Für Ihor Bielozorov jedoch stellt sich die Frage nicht: “Wir werden bleiben. Unsere Wohnung wurde zerstört, da müssen wir sowieso von Null anfangen”, sagt der Zahnarzt aus Kiew."

    "content": "Der Krieg in der Ukraine treibt Millionen in die Flucht. In Deutschland ächzen Helfer und Ämter. Wo bleibt die Politik?» DW: Original ArtikelReportage  Auslieferung: Deutsch  Adaptionen: Arabisch, Englisch, Russisch, KroatischDie Entscheidung zur Flucht fällt in einer Wohnung im vierten Stock am Rande von Kiew. Es ist der Vorabend des Krieges. Das Pärchen saß bereits auf gepackten Koffern. Noch in der Nacht verlassen Aljona und Denys die ukrainische Hauptstadt, fahren immer weiter Richtung Westen. Um vier Uhr früh ein Anruf von Denys Mutter: Sie ist noch in Kiew und hört die ersten Explosionen.17 Tage später sitzen Aljona und Denys in der Messehalle 13 in Hannover an einer Biertischgarnitur. Denn Hannover ist jetzt ein Drehkreuz für Flüchtende aus der Ukraine. Am Messebahnhof Laatzen fahren täglich mehrere Züge mit Geflüchteten ein, die  hier weiterverteilt werden sollen: Jeden Tag zwei Züge aus Frankfurt (Oder); dazu kommt dreimal pro Woche der Sonderzug der Deutschen Bahn aus Krakau. Hannover soll Berlin entlasten, bislang Hauptziel ukrainischer Geflüchteter. Ab dieser Woche kommt Cottbus als weiteres Drehkreuz dazu.Abfertigung in 20 MinutenEs ist 14:37, der Zug aus Frankfurt (Oder) rollt ein. 285 Menschen bekommen von den ersten Helfern eine FFP2-Maske, von den nächsten Helfern Wasser und ein Brötchen. An drei provisorischen Schaltern gibt die Bahn Tickets für die Weiterfahrt aus. Draußen auf dem Vorplatz verteilt Vodafone kostenlose Sim-Karten. 20 Minuten später hat sich der Messebahnhof wieder geleert.Wer in Hannover ankommt, hat drei Möglichkeiten: Direkt mit dem Zug weiterreisen; sich in der Messehalle 13 ausruhen; oder mit dem Bus verteilt werden. Die Zugreise organisiert die Bahn; ausruhen kann man sich in den Feldbetten der Landesaufnahmebehörde Niedersachsen; wer kein festes Ziel hat, wird vom Bundesamt für Güterverkehr mit Bussen verteilt.Im Auftrag des Verkehrsministeriums hat das Amt in Köln schon am 5. März einen Krisenstab mit 30 Mitarbeitern eingerichtet. Die Bundesländer melden über Verbindungsleute des Innenministeriums ihre Aufnahmekapazitäten. Dann schickt das Bundesamt für Güterverkehr die Busse los. Allein in der vergangenen Woche haben 149 Busse Hannover verlassen.Freiwillige statt staatlicher StrukturenAljona und Denys sind mit dem Bus aus Polen nach Hannover gekommen. Weil die 23-Jährigen noch nicht wissen, wohin sie als nächstes wollen, haben sie sich in Deutschland noch nicht bei den Behörden gemeldet. Ukrainer müssen das in der EU auch nicht. Sie können mit ihrem biometrischen Reisepass ohne Visum einreisen.Seit Invasionsbeginn vor vier Wochen hat die Bundespolizei bis zum 23. März genau 238.932 Kriegsvertriebene aus der Ukraine festgestellt. Nach der Einreise können die Menschen hinreisen, wohin sie wollen. Das stellt den Staat vor Probleme. Hier kommen die Freiwilligen ins Spiel.Krystyna Wierzbicka arbeitet eigentlich Vollzeit in einem Labor. Seit Kriegsausbruch füllt sie zusätzlich in Köln mit Flüchtenden Formulare aus und steht Schlange bei Behörden. Zum Beispiel vergangene Woche: Da wollte sie mit drei Frauen aus Lwiw beim Ausländeramt einen vorläufigen Aufenthaltstitel beantragen. Nachdem sie direkt nach ihrer Nachtschicht sechs Stunden beim Amt gewartet hatten, schloss dort aber zur Mittagszeit der Schalter. Die 54-Jährige kann nicht verstehen, dass in so einer Notsituation das Amt an seinen üblichen Öffnungszeiten festhält.Krystyna Wierzbicka ist Teil des Vereins “Sei Stark e.V.” in Köln, der sich für migrantische Frauen einsetzt. Den Verein hatte Emitis Pohl erst vor einem Monat gegründet. Nun koordiniert sie 15 Ehrenamtliche. “Sei Stark e.V.” ist Teil der viel beschworenen Zivilgesellschaft, die Flüchtende aus der Ukraine auffängt, die Wohnungen vermittelt, Übersetzungen für Amtsdeutsch schafft, Termine begleitet. Den Freiwilligen fällt auch die Erklärung zu, wieso vergangene Woche noch Gesundheitskarten ausgestellt wurden, diese Woche aber nicht. Die Helfer greifen nach eigener Aussage auch immer wieder ins eigene Portemonnaie: Für Lebensmittel, weil Termine beim Sozialamt auch mal zwei Wochen dauern. Für Medikamente, weil eben die Gesundheitskarten nicht mehr ausgestellt werden.Schulterklopfen von der Politik“Ein Staat funktioniert, indem sich nicht nur staatliche Behörden, sondern auch die Zivilgesellschaft bei großen Themen engagiert. Das ist gut, das ist erfreulich”, sagte Staatssekretär Wede Büchner vom Innenministerium vergangene Woche vor Journalisten.Das politische Berlin lässt derzeit kaum eine Gelegenheit aus, den Kommunen und den Ehrenamtlichen zu danken. Innenministerin Nancy Faeser wird nicht müde zu betonen, es ginge darum “unbürokratisch zu helfen”.Emitis Pohl wird sauer, wenn sie so etwas hört. Die “Sei Stark e.V.”- Gründerin bekommt Anrufe von Maklern, die leerstehende Wohnungen anbieten. Die Stadt aber habe die Miete nicht unbürokratisch übernehmen können. Hotels fragen bei ihr nach, wie und ob sie an öffentliches Geld kommen können, denn Pohl geht ans Telefon. “Die sollen in den Behörden mal menschlich denken, nicht verwaltungstechnisch,” sagt die ehemalige Unternehmerin und ergänzt: “Unsere Spender schätzen unseren Verein, weil wir schnell handeln und unbürokratisch sind.”Pressebild Emitis PohlZumindest in einer Hinsicht erweist sich dann auch das Sozialamt in Köln als unbürokratisch: Keine der drei Frauen aus Lwiw, die Krystyna Wierzbicka betreut, wurde nach ihrem Vermögen gefragt - dabei können Fliehende laut Gesetz nur Geld vom Staat bekommen, wenn sie weniger als 200 Euro Erspartes haben.Wie vorbereitet ist der Staat?Insgesamt haben nach Angaben des UN-Flüchtlingshilfswerks UNHCR seit Kriegsbeginn rund 3,6 Millionen Menschen die Ukraine verlassen. Außenministerin Annalena Baerbock rechnet damit, dass sich ihre Zahl auf acht Millionen erhöhen könnte. “Im Moment ist es so, dass ungefähr ein Drittel der Vertriebenen in die EU geht und zwei Drittel in der Ukraine bleiben,” sagt der Migrationsforscher Frank Düvell im DW-Gespräch. Auch er geht von steigenden Flüchtlingszahlen aus: “Die zentral-ukrainischen Regionen sind ja voll mit Binnenvertriebenen. Wenn die nun in der zweiten oder dritten Phase des Krieges angegriffen werden, müssen wir mit mindestens sieben Millionen weiteren Vertriebenen rechnen.”Die Politik versucht, sich auf dieses Szenario vorzubereiten. Noch ist vieles unklar. Zum Beispiel, wer für die Kosten aufkommt. Die Ministerpräsidentenkonferenz hatte sich vergangene Woche darauf geeinigt, bis zum 7. April in einer Arbeitsgruppe einen Vorschlag zu entwerfen. Denn die Anstrengungen sind massiv: Massenunterkünfte, Sozialleistungen und neue Registrierungszentren wie am ehemaligen Flughafen Tegel, wo die Bundeswehr mit 80 Soldatinnen und Soldaten unterstützt, sind das eine.Mehrkosten bei der Bahn beispielsweise, die Überstunden und freiwillige Mehrarbeit leistet sowie private Unterbringung sind das andere. Etwa zwei Drittel aller Flüchtenden aus der Ukraine kommen laut Berlins Ministerpräsidentin Franziska Giffey derzeit privat unter. Über geplante Kostenübernahmen in diesem Bereich oder finanzielle Entlastung für Ehrenamtliche schweigen die zuständigen Bundesministerien.Knackpunkt UmverteilungUnd zuletzt ist da die Umverteilung. Seit zwei Wochen soll in Deutschland nach dem sogenannten Königsteiner Schlüssel verteilt werden: Flüchtende können den Bundesländern entsprechend ihres Steueraufkommens und ihrer Bevölkerungszahl zugewiesen werden. Den langsam überforderten Bundesländern geht das aber nicht weit genug. Daher werden jetzt Rufe lauter, dass über einen europäischen Mechanismus zur Umverteilung nachgedacht werden müsse.Erst Anfang März wurde erstmals die EU-Richtline zum vorübergehenden Schutz beschlossen. Die sichert - eigentlich - Flüchtenden Freizügigkeit innerhalb der Europäischen Union zu. Umverteilungen auf europäischer Ebene könnte es damit nur auf freiwilliger Basis geben.Besonders betroffene Länder wie Polen schweigen bisher zur europäischen Umverteilung. Sie befürchten, dies würde am Ende eine gemeinsame EU-Migrationspolitik besiegeln.Dorothee Bär, stellvertretende Vorsitzende der CDU/CSU-Fraktion, verlangte am Mittwoch im Bundestag, Bundeskanzler Olaf Scholz müsse die Flüchtlingsaufnahme zur “Chefsache” machen. Unterstützung für diese Forderung kommt sogar vom Ampel-Koalitionspartner: NRW-Flüchtlingsminister Joachim Stamp, FDP, sagte im Deutschlandfunk, Kanzler Scholz solle zu einem nationalen Flüchtlingsgipfel einladen.Derweil überlegt das Pärchen aus Kiew wie es weiter gehen könnte. Aljona und Denys können sich von ihrem Ersparten derzeit noch ein billiges Hostel leisten. Beide sehnen sich nach etwas mehr Privatsphäre, einem eigenen Bad, Aussicht auf mehr als zwei Paar Jeans."

    "content": "Hunderttausende Menschen fliehen aus der Ukraine. Wie geht es für sie in Deutschland und in der Europäischen Union weiter? Antworten auf die wichtigsten Fragen.» DW: Original Artikel (gemeinsam mit Oliver Pieper)Explainer  Zwei Artikel, Updates im selben Artikel  Auslieferung: Deutsch  Adaptionen: Arabisch, EnglischEiniges ist ungewiss. Aber eines stellt das Bundesinnenministerium klipp und klar fest: Alle Menschen, die nach dem 24. Februar oder “nicht lange vor dem 24. Februar” aus der Ukraine geflüchtet sind, können ohne Visum nach Deutschland einreisen.Für ukrainische Staatsangehörige galt dies ohnehin. Eine Übergangsverordnung des Bundesinnenministeriums regelt dies jedoch für alle Flüchtenden unabhängig von ihrer Staatsbürgerschaft. Somit können sich alle Flüchtenden aus der Ukraine bis zum 23. Mai 2022 legal in der Bundesrepublik aufhalten.Um Sozialleistungen zu erhalten, müssen Flüchtende jedoch mit einem “Schutzgesuch” eine Aufenthaltserlaubnis beantragen (siehe unten).Wer erhält Schutz in Deutschland?Im Asyl-System der Europäischen Union entscheiden Mitgliedstaaten eigentlich auf Grund der individuellen Gefährdung von Geflüchteten über deren Status. In aufwendigen Rechtsverfahren werden dabei Einzelfälle bewertet. Dem entgegen haben die Innenminister und Innenministerinnen der Europäischen Union sich Anfang März verständigt, Menschen aus drei Gruppen unter Schutz zu stellen.Erstens, Ukrainer, die seit dem 24. Februar in Folge der russischen Invasion geflohen sind. Zweitens, Menschen aus Drittstaaten oder Staatenlose, die legal in der Ukraine lebten und denen es unmöglich ist, sicher in ihre Heimatländer zurückzukehren. Und drittens, Familienmitglieder der ersten beiden Gruppen.Deutschland | Ankunft von Ukraine Flüchtlingen in MünchenPersonen, die in der Ukraine studierten oder arbeiteten, aber in ihre Heimatländer sicher zurückkehren können, sind vom EU-Schutz ausgeschlossen. Trotzdem können sie laut Übergangsregelung bis zum 23. Mai in Deutschland bleiben und sich auch um andere Formen des Aufenthalts bemühen (s.u.).In Deutschland wird die EU-Richtlinie seit 2004 im Aufenthaltsgesetz Paragraph 24 umgesetzt.Was muss ich machen, um Schutz in Deutschland zu erhalten?Wer aus der Ukraine geflohen ist, erhält in den Mitgliedsstaaten der Europäischen Union temporär Schutz. In Deutschland wird unterschieden zwischen Fliehenden, die auf irgendeinem Weg privat eine Unterkunft finden und Menschen, die durch die Behörden untergebracht werden.Menschen, die privat unterkommen — bei Freunden, Familie oder einer privat vermittelten Unterkunft — können nach Auskunft des Bundesinnenministeriums an diesem Ort bleiben.Flüchtlinge, die durch die Behörden versorgt werden, werden deutschlandweit weiterverteilt und in Massenunterkünften, das heißt in Turnhallen, Messegeländen oder Schulen untergebracht. Bundesinnenministerin Nancy Faeser bestätigte im Deutschlandfunk, dass seit 14. März zur Verteilung von Flüchtlingen in die Bundesländer der so genannte Königsteiner Schlüssel angewendet wird. Das heißt, entsprechend des Steueraufkommens und der Bevölkerungszahl jedes Bundeslandes werden Flüchtlinge weiterverteilt.Nachdem Flüchtlinge an einer Adresse untergekommen sind, sollten Sie bei ihrer jeweiligen Ausländerbehörde oder Erstaufnahmeeinrichtung ein so genanntes “Schutzgesuch” äußern. Das heißt, sie beantragen eine Aufenthaltserlaubnis nach § 24 Aufenthaltsgesetz für den vorübergehenden Schutz. Anders als bei herkömmlichen Asylverfahren wird in diesem Schritt nicht der Pass der schutzsuchenden Person eingezogen. Eventuell wird jedoch eine Kopie angefertigt.Die Behörde stellt nach Beantragung der Aufenthaltserlaubnis eine so genannte “Fiktionsbescheinigung” aus. Das ist ein Dokument, das einen vorläufigen Aufenthaltstitel bescheinigt.Bisher ist noch unklar, wie sich dieser Prozess für Flüchtende ohne ukrainische Staatsbürgerschaft verhält. Drittstaatsangehörige und Staatenlose können ebenfalls ein Schutzgesuch äußern. Ob dem Schutzgesuch stattgegeben wird, ist jedoch offen, weil die EU-Richtlinie nur solche Drittstaatsangehörige und Staatenlose unter Schutz stellt, die “nicht sicher und dauerhaft in ihr Herkunftsland oder ihre Herkunftsregion zurückkehren können”. Asylrechtsexperten befürchten, dass Drittstaatler vor dem Gesetz schlechter gestellt werden als Ukrainer und vermuten, dass die Prüfung, ob Menschen sicher zurückkehren können, wieder langwierige Asylrechtsverfahren zur Folge haben.Welche Leistungen und Rechte stehen mir zu?Fliehenden aus der Ukraine stehen in Deutschland bestimmte Leistungen und Rechte nach dem Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz zu. Das heißt, sie können Geld und medizinische Versorgung erhalten und Arbeit aufnehmen.Die Leistungen können beim Sozialamt beantragt werden, und zwar unabhängig von einer Beantragung der Aufenthaltserlaubnis bei der Ausländerbehörde.Das Problem ist, dass Umfang und Umsetzung von Sozialleistungen deutschlandweit unterschiedlich geregelt sind und sich sogar zwischen Kommunen desselben Bundeslands unterscheiden können.Fest steht, dass Fliehende, die weniger als 200 Euro Vermögen haben, Anspruch auf existenzsichernde Sozialleistungen haben. Monatlich sind das für alleinstehende Erwachsene 367 Euro. Weitere Gelder kommen je nach Einzelfall hinzu.Akute medizinische Versorgung wie bei Verletzungen müssen in Krankenhäusern versorgt werden. Die Krankenhäuser können sich die Kosten beim Sozialamt erstatten lassen. Für die Behandlung planbarer Eingriffe erhalten Flüchtende in manchen Bundesländern und Kommunen so genannte Gesundheitskarten, über die medizinische Versorgung abgerechnet wird. Ohne Gesundheitskarte muss jede Behandlung vorher beim Sozialamt beantragt werden.Aber unter der bisherigen Gesetzgebung werden nicht alle medizinischen Leistungen übernommen. Zum Beispiel sind psychotherapeutische Behandlung oder Versorgung chronischer Krankheiten nur bei “besonderen Bedürfnissen” vorgesehen. Experten kritisieren, dass diese Einschränkung seit Anfang März nicht mehr zulässig sei.Umfassendere Gesundheitsversorgung erhalten Flüchtlinge, wenn sie über Familienmitglieder, die bereits in Deutschland krankenversichert sind, mitversichert werden. Das ist jedoch in der Regel nur für Ehegatten, Lebenspartner und deren Kinder bzw. Enkel möglich.Darf ich in Deutschland arbeiten?Für Aufsehen hat gesorgt, dass Flüchtende aus der Ukraine sofort arbeiten dürfen. In einem Schreiben vom 14. März, das der DW vorliegt, erklärt das Bundesinnenministerium, dass sowohl Anstellungen, wie auch selbstständige Tätigkeiten erlaubt seien und im Aufenthaltstitel “Erwerbstätigkeit erlaubt” eingetragen werden muss.Aus Kreisen der Arbeitsagenturen heißt es, dass zusätzliche Übersetzer bereitgestellt werden, um bei der Vermittlung zu helfen. Der Chef der Bundesagentur für Arbeit, Detlef Scheele, sagte vergangene Woche, dass noch abgewartet werden müsse, “welche Möglichkeiten uns die Politik gesetzlich gibt zu helfen, wie viele Menschen zu uns kommen, welche Befugnisse sie haben und wie sich die gesamte Situation weiter entwickelt.”Kann ich hinziehen, wo ich will?Die Aktivierung des vorübergehender Schutzmechanismus auf EU-Ebene hat noch eine weitere asylpolitische Revolution mit sich gebracht: Zum ersten Mal müssen Fliehende nicht in dem EU-Land bleiben, in dem sie zum ersten Mal in die EU eingereist sind.Flüchtende aus der Ukraine können sich aussuchen, in welchem EU-Land sie sich niederlassen. Asylrechtsexperten weisen allerdings darauf hin, dass Leistungen und Rechte, die mit dem Schutzmechanismus einher gehen, nur im Land des ersten Antrags gelten.Der EU-Mechanismus sieht zwar vor, dass Flüchtende auch später noch in ein anderes Land umsiedeln können, wenn die betroffenen EU-Staaten zustimmen. Derzeit gibt es jedoch keine Plattform, über die dieser Austausch stattfinden soll.Gibt es andere Wege, in Deutschland zu bleiben?Auf Grundlage des Aufenthaltsgesetz § 24 zum vorübergehenden Schutz können Flüchtende eine Aufenthaltsgenehmigung beantragen. Aber es gibt noch weitere Möglichkeiten,  Fliehende können auch andere Gründe angeben. Zum Beispiel, ein Studium oder Ausbildung zu beginnen oder abzuschließen, als Fachkraft in Deutschland zu arbeiten oder die Familie zusammen zu führen. Alle diese Begründungen können zu einem längerfristigen Aufenthaltstitel in Deutschland führen.Dennoch gelten unter diesen Gründen einige Einschränkungen. Ausländische Studierende müssen beispielsweise einen Studienplatz und finanzielle Mittel im Wert von 10.332 € vorweisen können, um einen Aufenthaltstitel zu erhalten.Was ist der “temporary protection mechanism”?Die EU-Richtlinie des vorübergehenden Schutzes heißt auf Englisch “temporary protection mechanism”. Auf Deutsch wird sie häufig als “Massenzustromrichtlinie” bezeichnet, “Richtlinie über temporären Schutz” wäre aber die korrekte Übersetzung. Der Mechanismus wurde 2001 unter dem Eindruck des zweiten Balkan-Kriegs in das EU-Recht aufgenommen. Die Regelung sollte eine Lehre aus der Situation Vertriebener aus dem Kosovo sein, um in Zukunft schnell und unbürokratisch Menschen unter Schutz stellen zu können.Wenn die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten den temporary protection mechanism aktivieren, passieren zwei Dinge. Einerseits stellen sie damit fest, dass so viele Menschen in die EU fliehen, dass damit das konventionelle Asylsystem überfordert wird. Andererseits erhalten damit Flüchtende sofort rechtlichen Schutz.Zudem birgt die Richtlinie einen Mechanismus zur EU-internen Umverteilung von Flüchtenden. 2003 wollte Spanien mit Hilfe der Regelung irakische Kriegsflüchtlinge schützen, 2011 forderten Malta und Italien die Aktivierung für Flüchtende aus Libyen. Das Europäische Parlament beantragte 2015 den Schutz syrischer Kriegsflüchtlinge mit Hilfe der Regelung. Die EU-Staaten konnten sich jedoch bisher nie auf einen Verteilmechanismus einigen, daher scheiterten die Bemühungen und jeder Staat betrieb eigene Initiativen.Diesmal einigten sich die Innenminister auf einen freiwilligen Verteilmechanismus. Die EU-Mitgliedsstaaten sollen lediglich anzeigen, über wieviel Kapazität sie verfügen. Flüchtende können in einen anderen Mitgliedsstaat umsiedeln, wenn dieser zustimmt. Asylrechtsexperten bewerten dieses System als flexibler, da es Flüchtenden entgegen der eigentlich geltenden Dublin-Verordnung Freizügigkeit innerhalb der EU gewährt.Die Aktivierung des Mechanismus bringt daher verschiedene Vorteile. Flüchtende, die von der Regelung erfasst sind, erhalten Zugang zum Sozialsystem, die Mitgliedstaaten müssen sich etwa um eine Wohnung und für Kinder auch um den Schulunterricht kümmern. Zudem erhalten alle, die von der Regelung eingeschlossen sind, umgehend in allen EU-Staaten eine Arbeitserlaubnis.Darüber hinaus bringt die Regelung insbesondere für Asylbehörden Entlastung, da nun nicht mehr Einzelfälle geprüft werden müssen.Dieser Text wurde am 2. März zuerst veröffentlicht und am 15. März aktualisiert."

    "content": "One and a half weeks of format development for the Hungary department. We were put to the task of developing a facebook video format that engages healthy online discussions — because Hungarians are so polarized.This design challenge had been developed previously in-house and we worked as a group on this task. After seven working days, that is nine calender days there was supposed to be a result usable by the Hungary department. The goal was to develop a format so tangible that the next month the department can create full-fleged pilot of this show.The development process we underwent was incredibly well managed, designed, and carried out. And it totally deserved the plea the instructors kept putting at us: Trust the process. If you ask me now, I’d say: “Trust the process because it delivers results through exploitation.”Design Thinking GoodiesThe goodies described here may or may not have to do with design thinking. Since our process was a design thinking process these are the goodies I’m taking away from this process and they may relate to design thinkingThere are many bits and pieces I am taking away from this time — gosh, after five days of intense labor, frustration, and hate against the methods used during this design marathon I even designed a workshop for a private project using precisely these methods. So, definitely valuable lessons learned.Front and center: Constraints spurr creativity. A development workshop that intends to create a clear product with a clearly defined need but brings in 14 minds is only possible with clear, focussed, and hard moderation. Working in groups, moderators need to be on their toes, to intervene whenever the group strays off topic or looses itself in detail. It helps to have tangible moderation, i.e. some form of visualization of the process. Our workshop made good use of Miro to keep the process in shape.Small steps: Boil your process down into small approachable and easy to fulfill challenges. Think in compartments: There is an overall challenge and there are several steps to take to get towards a result. Then break down the several steps until you are there with step-entities that can be as short as one minute. Set a timer for each step to (1) add creativity constraints, and (2) keep the group on topic. It creates stress and you may feel or smell it in your armpits but it is a killer feature to bolster a group process. Not everybody can work like this.Use a variety of methods for the same task:  Some people are creative in very open brainstorming sessions.  Some people like to work independently but co-create in “yes-and” settings.  Some people work visually in mood boards.  Some people like abstractions like seeking the patterns in user-interviews (e.g. He says: “I like long interviews because you get behind the scenes info on a person” and he says: “With an audience present in the interview its not as intimate anymore” $\\rightarrow$ he may like to feel special)Iterate: Have an idea, spin it, develop it, deploy it, get feedback, spin it, develop it, deploy it, get feedback; keep repeating and then just stop. Your output will be a working snapshot.Produce for purpose: Many people get stuck with creative processes because they want great output. For a design process this is the wrong approach. With an iterative process you don’t go for great output, you merely go for good enough. You will always be able to improve on your output. But if the goal is to produce a prototype that sort of shows in a tangible way what you’d like your format to look and feel like, don’t fret with creative video editing. Your purpose is to give a sense of how this is supposed to look and feel, not to gain additional viewership on your publication. Writing this there is a hint in the word already: Publication is public. But public may not be the purpose.Lastly, user centeredness: The process began with interviewing possible Hungarian users and developing a collective user-persona with specific needs and traits. All intermediate and final results were checked against these needs and traits. I put this aspect last because even though I know this isn’t standard procedure in developing design it should be.These steps and all the others I didn’t mention yield results. In just 9 calender days we were able to create a fully fleged format for a department that works in a language none of us speak. And while this development process isn’t finished yet — Hungary will now produce the pilot — I can see that this product may be successful. The process delivered results.Design Thinking BadiesBadies are antonyms to goodies. However, with respect to the process we underwent my critique isn’t related to singular bits that didn’t work for me. Rather, I’d like to propose the argument that the process delivered results through exploitation.There are four aspects that seem to have made the process successful: (1) structure[1], (2) time pressure, (3) competition, and (4) highly motivated staff.I discussed structure and time pressure above. Both seem to be the important guideposts to channel all that creativity into a well defined river of output. What I am concerned with is both competition and the highly motivated staff.79% of the workshop time our staff goup was split into either two or four. Initially this provided smaller groups to work in and allowed to recombine and thus iterate the findings of the results. This is helpful because each group may develop a specific and highly useful focus. Merging these foci generally allows to add onto each other in a substantial way.At two junctions the split groups competed against each other, however. Each sub-group would develop their own idea and then pitch it to a jury. The jury then would decide which idea to pursue further. After each such decision the sub-groups not picked would then merge into the other groups.Now, instructors would stress during each of these competing rounds that »all ideas are our ideas« and it isn’t about winning or loosing. But this is just words.Now, the main point here is that merging into new teams after your idea wasn’t picked isn’t too bad. I think it shouldn’t be overdramatized or overthought. But I’d like to point out that it involves emotional labour.How do you integrate new people into a team? You explain to them why you made decisions previously, you try to work on the knowledge hierarchies that developed. Positions are sticky though: If somebody drove an idea early on they develop ownership for it and will retain this ownership even if new people merge into this team.Ownership is an emotional category, however and the only way to build ownership in a new arrival or transfer ownership to the new arrival is through emotional labor: People who initially held ownership need to let go, listen to the new arrivals, ask them for feedback, see what they need, and (this may sound crazy) tend to their wounds from the lost battle before.A tight schedule as ours does not allow to do that labor. Positions within the process become entrenched, with some doing the shitty work and others sticking with the fun stuff, knowledge hierarchies entrench with the new arrivals not really voicing their opinions anymore and thus attaining no ownership.Such a process is emotionally draining. Ideas one worked on intensely get ditched and adaption to the new standard, the idea one got merged into takes an emotional toll. This toll is the emotional exploitation necessary to make the process work. If you have highly motivated staff, they will plough through it. They may have a healthy way of dealing with it or they will ignore it and work hard even though they are drained. If your staff isn’t highly motivated there numerous ways of ditching the process. But of course its a group effort and you pay in increments of emotion to be part of the group.Footnotes:  [1] E.g. Clear goal, good moderation, precise methods"

Single-handedly she rebuffs shallow critique about ordering at the food delivery.It is a late evening and being a great host she just virtually went to the kiosk and have somebody bring two more cases of beer. I ask her whether she had already tipped and of course she had, on the app.Me, still feeling guilty that I didn’t contribute to this evening materially and feeling guilty that a migrant worker has to work with Gorillaz, I run downstairs and tip again.Now with a fresh beer in hand, we keep discussing the business model Gorillaz and Flink.

Because there aren’t that many entry level jobs that don’t require great command of German.Delivery riding requires no German skills and can be done part-time, so studying is still possible. At the same time students from India often receive some support from home, so a job like with Gorillaz may suffice.For others, it isn’t enough. Anoter friend spent years wrangling with the German migration system. He is seeking asylum for political prosecution in Latin America. He has a masters degree and work experience in tech so getting a job in Germany was simple for him. Nevertheless, he spent months in a refugee camp and later refugee accomodation in Leipzig.After being officially allowed to stay in the country without  asylum fully approved, German authorities push refugees to find work, Pedro says. Many now find it with Amazon. Their warehouses offer entry level jobs, with no German required and full time positions. But, they offer little future, ways to climb the ladder.But often refugees never even enter the official workforce. They stay within illicit employment.Pedro noticed cars of construction companies parked outside his refugee accomodation outside Leipzig quickly. »They approach refugees and ask them to work doing basic construction work. They promise 15 to 20 Euros an hour,« says Pedro.Now, Pedro has friends who sit on piles of cash. Since the money was earned illegally, it cannot be used to rent an appartment or sent home to support their family. »This one friend of mine lives with his employer, they do scaffolding, and his rent is simply deducted from his illicit wage«.Many refugees in vulnerable position turn to prostitution however. »I know an albino person who tends to sexual kinks of a whole range of clients,« says Pedro.What remains is an understudied and underrepored topic that doesn’t even have any readers.Issues with the story:- Focus unclear: Migration or Refugees in Germany?- Research necessary on:   - Food Delivery and Migration (Statistics?)  - Amazon and work perspective  - entry-level service industry and job security- O-Töne  - Balance: Ask for comment    - Amazon    - Gorillaz  - Union/Initiative  - A rider themselves"

    "content": "A week of interview-training, mostly 3:30 live-interviews for radio or TV. One day of vox pops and focus, focus, focus. Some notes of what I took away from this week.GoalHave a clear goal in mind for each interview. Then develope your driving question and a (max) nine-letter headline that answers your question. This helps you to have focus during the interview and not loose track in your line of questioning.  Which type?          Information about the matter (with an expert)      Profile about the person      Opinion on a topic        Driving Question  Nine-Letter headline          Found this very helpful to define where I want to go with the interview, what is it supposed to bring?      Define narrow and sigular focus (do you have only one focus?!)      PreparationPreparation is key for a good interview. Talk to your interviewee in a pre-chat and be sure of a killer first question.      Pre-Chat          Define focus      Possibly tell about first question      Tell them to keep it short and simple, no jargon      Possibly get a voice message w/ their name pronounciation      How do they want to be introduced?      Why are they relevant for the topic?      How do they look/sound? (More headspace is better than too little)            First Question          Depends, may give too much away, can set the tone      Politician: Be provocative, then follow up      Expert: Don’t provoke them, they talk too long and you can’t be rude      Possibly just let them describe:                  How big is this?          What are the parts of this?          Give us an example                    Headline as first question: May be punchy but may take away the whole story; May allow them to stray too much            Structure          Micro-Macro-Micro-other Macro is super nice      Possibly establish context with first question: »How does it feel to be a black man in Brazil?«      Most important thing front and center (significance)            Moderation          Erklärmoderation, if a lot has to be explained      Try not to have wikipedia-moderation, narrate like in a bar      Keep moderation very close to the topic      Make clear why you’re talking to this guest        Abmoderation          Write it beforehand      If nothing else: »Does the central bank still have power to deal with inflation. I talked about this with ECB spokesperson XYZ«      Great, if you can summarize what was discussed      No additional information in the Abmoderation (may be cut out)        Helpers:          Write down list of possible interruptions: »Do you mean…«, »Why do you say that exactly?«, »To be clear…« (great one)      Write down what answers may be      If question isn’t answered, ask again      How to conductYou can make sure to take care of these steps while conducting the interview. It makes it better.  Questions:          Never do bundled questions      Ask open questions but frame them with examples: »How are middle classes in turkey suffering from inflation, for exampe families in their housing situations?«      Pointed questions are great        Inserts          No Quittungssätze (»interessant«, »great«, »really«)      Floskeln vermeiden: »In the studio with me…«, »Ich würde dich gern fragen…« (Could be different in very personal interview)      Add context also with obvious stuff: »Why are protests impossible right now?«      Interrupt for clarifications      Long replies: Add signposts to take control and add orientation. »Do I understand correctly that…«, »You said this and this what about [next question]«        Don’t wobble with your body. Any nodding that you’d normally do is fine  Wear clothes with contrasts, not too dark, not too small patternsVoxesVox-pops were also part of this interview training. We went outside to find regular people in Bonn and ask them of their opinions. Making good vox-pops isn’t as easy as you’d think but having a good one adds emotion and relatability to your journalistic output. Vox-pops are never standalone journalistic publications but are rather embedded into a whole piece. The nice thing about having good voxes is, you can use them accross your publications. If they are filmed, you can use the audio and transcripts in other media-types.  Ask personal questions          How do you feel about…?      How does … affect you?        If you ask »what should be done about…«, people want to be correct and you get political answers  Keep asking the same questions but keep digging  Edit to have people who bring new perspectives  You want “characters”  Be aware: Voices may blend into each other; It’s a problem  You can use the same person several times if they’re great  Dramaturgie: Strong-Middle-Strong  Complex topic:          Repeat opinions to let them sink in      Be aware: Is everyone answering the same question? Otherwise you may have a lot of confusion.      My InterviewsI conducted these five interviews during the week with differing interview partners. Three with video, two only audio. I just love sitting in the radio studio and casually chatting with a person. Andreas suggested to have the cappuchino effect: Make it sound as if you just talk over a cup of coffee.  What’s the way forward for Ghana’s national soccer team after they crashed out of the AFCON? (Eddy)  How does Albania not dealing with its dictatorship affect people today? (Astrid)  What’s the state of the Belarussian opposition? (Tanja)  How do you make interdisciplinary art? (Jazz Violinist and circus/theater person)  The ECB cannot change inflation right now. (ECB spokesperson)"

    "content": "This week has a theme: Looking at the beast. It follows how to do journalism in 2022, what asset manager capitalism is, and how you scrape twitter.Kaminska off-balance sheetIzabella Kaminska left the Financial Times and now runs her own media venture »The Blindspot«. With her own enterprise she aims twofold: First, figure out how media works by having your own media outlet. And second, being able to push the limits of group think.  In the journalistic field, being innovative means figuring out what  uncomfortable realities should warrant investigations and which should  not. It also means standing up to consensus and pushing ahead on stories that the evidence implies there is something to, even if doing so is  unpopular. Other times it just means finding more compelling media or  mechanisms to bring the stories to market.She also went to do a Reddit AMA, apparently also to simply advertise her new outlet. On it, I enjoyed to read her arguments of »always going against the wind, to be opinionally countercyclical«.With regards to journalism, I found her take on being fresh and new quite enlightening.  If I publish something and it is  clearly proven to be wrong or lacking the consideration of a key point,  it’s important to be transparent, admit the mistake, correct it and move wrong.  We are all human so mistakes will happen. I think your readers are forgiving providing you are transparent.  This is often the case with new topics that you are only beginning to cover. But it’s also important to be a journalistic newbie in my opinion.  Having a fresh perspective is important. There is a fine balance between expertise and freshness. Expert journal can go native in the sectors  they cover. Their sources become their friends. They fear upsetting  people or burning bridges. So you need a continuous  shake up and moving into news sectors you know less about is usually quite good for that,  but you can make early mistakes as you familiarise yourself with the  markets.Blyth on BraunMark Blyth gave a 20 minute lecture on Ben Braun’s work asset manager capitalism (AMC). His introduction on how Ben’s work brings the intellectual shift in political science and sociology after 2008 to a new hight very much resonated. Three points to take away: 1) AMC holds societies hostage over the climate crisis, bringing an unjust future, 2) AMC displays a shift of power to the top 1% because of asset proliferation and risk diffusion to the public, and 3) AMC signals solely wealth preservation and I cannot stop thinking of the Hunger Games.  Blackrock’s Larry Fink’s short squeeze, expecting the public balance sheet to take on all risks; So as Blyth says: »Economic transition but you can forget about all the just part.«  US households as shareholders may be the owners of companies. But looking at the numbers it is precisely the top 1% who own at least 50% of all the shares and the asset managers are their agents. And through ever more ETF issuance on the same underlying collateral, they create more assets for this class »at the cost of creating systemic risk for everybody else.« This is the rise of passive investment takes away the “big pocket investors” (Mehrling), nobody provides an outside spread, but the state/central bank.  For Blyth the biggest takeaway is, that the entrepeneurial function of capitalism is gone. The new paradigma is wealth preservation because shares are assets to generate fees (for asset managers).Twitter download w/o APIHN brought to my attention the possibility to mine twitter data without the use of APIs. Someone linked their GUI Tweetfeast. Others suggested to use the Python option Twit, but I’ve got to admit I don’t know if my pip is actually up and running or not. I’m just glad to have sorted out my Ruby this week.This siteManaged to get this page up and running on https://nullnein.onrender.com/. Happy to share the config soon. Still some stuff to do but learning the whole jekyll game.Artists’ self-preoccupationDie chinesische haute couture Designerin Guo Pei sagt im Zeit Magazin Nr. 6, 3.2.2022:  Haben Sie sich in den vergangenen Jahren viel mit anderen Couturiers in Paris ausgetauscht?  Nicht wirklich. […] Am letzten Abend der Fashion week gibt es ein Dinner, das die Couuture-Kammer veranstaltet. Da sagt man sich kurz Hallo.  Nicht mehr?  Nein. Jeder von uns hat als Künstler bereits seine eigene Welt geschaffen, die so reich ist, dass man sie nicht mehr verlassen will. Wenn du jung bist, stehst du noch in einem leeren Raum, den du mit Dingen von außen füllen willst. Unsere Welt quillt dagegen schon über, der eine Designer hat seine Ideen, ich habe meine, weder ist er auf meine neugierig noch ich auf seine. Mehr als ein Hallo ist nicht nötig.Im engen Kontrast lese ich Heimo Schlinks Hesse Biographie und von Hesses Obsession und kleinteiliger Korrespondenz mit seiner Leserschaft, seinem Austausch mit Hugo Ball, Mann, seinen Briefwechseln mit Frauen und Freunden. Und dennoch scheint auch Hesse mit dieser Einzigartigkeit seines Seins zu spielen, diese geradezu zur Kunstform zu erheben. All sein Schreiben ist doch  Auseinandersetzung mit seiner Person und Schlink schließt sogar, dass Hesses Leiden selbstgewählt ist, um dieses Schreiben erst zu ermöglichen."

    "content": "This week brought a crash course into radio. While killing your darlings is important to all work, I’ll mention it here because it hit me here so strongly.The first pieceI did two pieces. One on how DW protects their journalists in Germany, with violence against members of the press increasing, as also NGOs report. For this piece, I interviewed DW’s reporter on right-wing movements who by coincidence also interviewed me during the DW assessment center. I messed up the piece in two ways: I spoke my narration too slowly and then tried to cover it by putting dramatic music. Major learning: Practice speech (more below).The second pieceThen I met Klaus, who runs a currywurst bude just accross from DW, on the Rhine. Beautiful interview, great partner, would like to get back to him again./assets/currywurst-final.mp3Major learnings:  Take your time when getting to a scenery. Have a cup of coffee first, be patient, chill and then figure out where to to the interview.  Hold the microphone really close, otherwise the voice is too low and if you boost the volume there will be background.  Ask them to turn off music to have a quite place for a chat.  Chat to them first, then turn on the machine.  Kill your darlings: I had so many nice quotes but having less in the piece would have been more.Overall learnings  Anmoderation/Narration          Don’t reveal too much in the Anmoderation, make listeners curious; But use Anmoderation to place the story.      Write teaser/Anmoderation first. Then you will know where you’re going.      See Anmoderation and Narration as one unit.      Anmoderation: Put the listener on the track for the first part of the piece      Cappuchino-Effect: Tell your story over a cup of coffee.      Your hook needs to be close to your agenda.      Structuring Narration: Use simple stuff: Sleep, eat, toilet but be aware if the simple structure fits your story      Push background info into the middle of your story, be scenic.      Use your experts to give examples, provide pictures. Put explanation into your narration.      Be aware to portray your people well. Even if they use Phrasen that may portray them, don’t put them, it doesn’t do them justice.        Production:          Have subjects help you: Quiet place, turn off music      Before you go out: Check of your subject can answer your driving question.      If you talk to a customer/visitor, make sure their statement fits/enhances the story      Music works to show something: I.e. cliché music (hip-hop) can introduce a scenery (young people) but is context/audience specific      Always record a lot of long ambience on the ground      Atmo: Is it clear what the Atmo is? Is it aggressive or drunk people yelling? Which picture do you see when hearing the sound?        Technical stuff          The auto-level can boost background noise in short breaks of speech      Clean »ahs« from soundbites      Check level of recorded voice visually on recording device      Check level of ambience with your ears through headphones      Sinnverstehendes LesenAndreas nennt ordentliches Sprechen für’s Radio »Sinnverstehendes Lesen«, das Internet verortet den Begriff in der Grundschule.Wichtige Punkte:  Text nicht in Grammatik unterteilen, sondern in Sinnabschnitte  Text durchgehen und markieren:          Pausen      Binden      Stimme Runter        Immer ganz einatmen, dann kommt man auch weit  Geschwindigkeit: Wie mit einem normalen Menschen reden  Fragezeichen: Stimme hoch, Betonung auf Fragewort  Deutsche Bühnenhochlautung:          Endung -ig: König wird Könich      Endung -en: Essen wird Essn      Im Zweifel: Aussprachedatenbank      "

    "content": "I’ve been nerding out about web development since I’m like 13 or 14 years old. While my first webpages were html-only, at some point designing them in Photoshop and then ‘slicing’ them up into pictures to then hosting them via tables on html became a big deal. All of this obviously was before people accessed websites on their phones.Since I’m obsessed with getting stuff as cheap as possible or best case for free, I’ve been tinkering with web development that gets me there as well.Which means, running this website comes at pretty much no cost to me and is – as far as I can tell also the only way to run a website as complex as this one for free.I pay for the Domain and yes, a .lol-Domain is pricey but worth the joke. But that’s the only cost attached to this site.That comes with some drawbacks quirks on usability. Upfront: I run this site with the comand-line CMS Jekyll, it’s hosted on github (free storage) and then pushed to Render.com, which hosts plain-text file websites for free.The reason for pushing from Github to Render is, it gives me flexibility on plugins and themes which Github’s Jekyll integration does not.How I publishAs a software stack, I use a combination of Sublime Text, iA Writer, the Terminal and obviously Git to do this stuff.

GoatCounter AnalyticsIn _layouts/default.html before &lt;/body&gt; added:    &lt;script data-goatcounter=\"https://mikrophaenomene.goatcounter.com/count\" async src=\"//gc.zgo.at/count.js\"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;However: uBlock origin blocks GoatCounter which is fine for me. Also localhost serves of jekyll call at GoatCounter so test environment may mess up the count but since uBlock blocks it it should be fine.Took out license and sharing at post bottomBecause of unclarity around licensing, I decided to opt for a “some rights reserved” in the footer. Thus, I needed to take out the CC license at the bottom of each post. Also, I don’t like sharing buttons. So the whole piece had to go.In layouts/posts.html I deleted this whole section at the bottom:  &lt;div class=\"post-tail-bottom    d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center mt-3 pt-5 pb-2\"&gt;    &lt;div class=\"license-wrapper\"&gt;          &lt;/div&gt;    &lt;!-- Post sharing snippet --&gt;&lt;div class=\"share-wrapper d-flex align-items-center\"&gt;  &lt;span class=\"share-label text-muted me-1\"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=\"share-icons\"&gt;                            &lt;a        href=\"https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Configuration%20this%20site%20-%20mathis&amp;url=%2Fposts%2Fconfiguration-this-site%2F\"        data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"        data-bs-placement=\"top\"        title=\"Twitter\"        target=\"_blank\"        rel=\"noopener\"        aria-label=\"Twitter\"      &gt;        &lt;i class=\"fa-fw fa-brands fa-square-x-twitter\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;      &lt;/a&gt;                &lt;a        href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?title=Configuration%20this%20site%20-%20mathis&amp;u=%2Fposts%2Fconfiguration-this-site%2F\"        data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"        data-bs-placement=\"top\"        title=\"Facebook\"        target=\"_blank\"        rel=\"noopener\"        aria-label=\"Facebook\"      &gt;        &lt;i class=\"fa-fw fab fa-facebook-square\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;      &lt;/a&gt;                &lt;a        href=\"https://t.me/share/url?url=%2Fposts%2Fconfiguration-this-site%2F&amp;text=Configuration%20this%20site%20-%20mathis\"        data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"        data-bs-placement=\"top\"        title=\"Telegram\"        target=\"_blank\"        rel=\"noopener\"        aria-label=\"Telegram\"      &gt;        &lt;i class=\"fa-fw fab fa-telegram\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;      &lt;/a&gt;        &lt;button      id=\"copy-link\"      aria-label=\"Copy link\"      class=\"btn small\"      data-bs-toggle=\"tooltip\"      data-bs-placement=\"top\"      title=\"\"      data-title-succeed=\"\"    &gt;      &lt;i class=\"fa-fw fas fa-link pe-none\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;    &lt;/button&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .post-tail-bottom --&gt;Took out pagination on post bottomDeleted contents of _includes/post-nav.html.Setup  [x]installing ruby  [x]installing jekyll          continue at “Get your Ruby version:”        [ ]installing chirby on github pages  setup guide  setup at nullnein.onrender.com, run:          jekyll bundle exec jekyll build      push to github not automated yet      I think render will automatically redeploy        How github/jekyll workflow works, very basic tutorial  How to linkStuff to figure outimage handling  Typora imputs into assets folder  assets has subfolders by category  attibute image path as /assets/image-path.extensionadd tag-archivehttps://brettterpstra.com/projects/jtag/  change nil to none in tags_json.html  change config.yml to point to https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nullnein/site-deploy/main/data/tags.jsonFootnotes            I’ve created an espanso-package, its pending approval.

    "content": "  The Third Pole is a publication on issues related to the climate crisis with a special focus on Global South countries. They make strong use of linking to scientific papers and interlinking other reporting.          I was especially taken by their report on natural calamities causing mental health issues in northern Pakistan. Apparently, mental health effects of the climate crisis are understudied.      They make wide use of linking to scientific papers, i.e. this one that argues for causal link between higher female representation in national parliaments and stronger climate policy outcomes.        Reuters produced a clever and simple explainer on the Tonga erruption using a gif of the ash plume overlaid onto various landmasses for context.  Fahrrad-Tools is a nice way to make knowledge on bicycle lables accessible: It searches a database of matches the label on your tire if you wonder which tube or tire fits."

    "content": "One week of learning to write well. Our trainers focussed on what is in German called the »Reportage«. The following is a list of tricks they suggested. Some, I just wrote down like this, some they said so specifically.Detail makes a story pop  What was the weather like?  What did the trees look like?  How was the smell, did the small change?  How does it feel to be hungry? What goes through your mind? Can you give us a picture of this scenery?  What do you do with your hands if you feel uncomfortable? Did you already do this when you were young?  What is something you like to spend money on? What does your purse look like?Get language to the point  Start with the last sentence  The last sentence of your paragraph should sum it up and be strong  Don’t use adverbs, use strong verbs.  Be cautious with quotations. They take the reader out of the action  Describe not as a Steckbrief but with movement:          »Masha moved towards the windows where a buffet offered solace.«      »He combed his shoulderlong hair with his fingers.«        Use short words.  Use active voice.  Use specific words where you suspect abstract words: They don’t buy groceries. They buy apples, bread, and butter.  Use the ladder of abstraction (zweite Ebene):          What does it mean?      What is this an instance of?        Start right in the middle (of the action).  Be cautious when describing eyes/view/Blick.  If you’re stuck writing: Read people you like and then write.Interview well.  Try not to take notes.  Trust your memory.  Treat your interviee as an expert.  Come back to a challenging situation and ask again.  Be bold.  Ask for detail.  Ask for turning points, biographical meaning."

    "content": "Natürlich war es eine Auszeichnung von Bärbel ein Briefchen zu bekommen. Er war ja nicht der Hübscheste. Zugesteckt zwischen den Schulbänken, hin und her, bis Peter sie nach Hause bringen durfte. Aus der Schule raus und durch die Kleinstadt hindurch, an seinem Elternhaus vorbei und dann diese Stiege hoch, spazierten die beiden. Damals hieß das: Miteinander gehen.Zum Zwischenstop saßen sie auf einer Bank, sie 14, er 14, unromantisch, ohne Weitblick, einfach nebeneinander. Denn verborgen sollte es sein.Doch Peter war forsch, fragte, ob er sie nicht die Lateinvokabeln abfragen dürfe. Zuhause natürlich. Denn ungetört mussten sie sein. Blicke umher, ob da nicht jemand kommt und dann kurz, ein Kuss. Nur kurz. Ein Aufeinandertreffen zweier Münder. Denn was sollten die Leute denken.Jetzt ist er 80 und Peter steht stramm, kugelrund und sein Schnurrbart formt seinem Schmunzeln einen wohligen Unterschlupf. Er sieht sich um und raunt: »Nicht, dass meine Frau von der Geschichte erfährt.«Kommentar:  Starker Schluss, Pointe: Elegant mit Zitat aufhören  Gute Szenerie  Kürze bringts"

    "content": "Plötzlich stehen die Schlagzeilen einfach so in der Luft. FM lange, geraden Finger einfach so Trump und Djokovic beiseite gewischt. Nun wird in diesen Zeilen Politik aus der Sicht von Bauern und Arbeitern erzählt.Der Mann aus Ruanda ist heute Stratege für die Deutsche Welle, den Auslandssender der Bundesregierung. Jetzt will er die Medien verändern, so dass sie nicht jeder politischen Finte auflaufen. Denn er hat es alles gesehen: Hunger, Völkermord und die Bedrohung des eigenen Lebens.FM kommt 1981 in einem Flüchtlingslager in Uganda zur Welt. Sein Vater war als Tutsi aus Ruanda vertrieben worden. Bekannte zogen ihn auf, aber das Essen war knapp, manchmal Tage und Wochen, ohne etwas zu essen. Der Hunger ist nichts, keine Energie, keine Gedanken, kein Tun. M war benommen und taub. Nur eins wusste er: Er würde nicht sterben.Noch in Uganda schloss sich M als 10-Jähriger Tutsi-Truppen an. Damals Normalität für Jungen, die nicht wissen was es bedeutet zu töten, die aber eine Waffe tragen wollen. Zur Invasion wurden die Kinder 1992 nach Ruanda gefahren, zu hunderten wie Hühner in Lastwägen gepfercht. FM weiß nur von drei Kameraden aus den Lastwägen, die drei Jahre später noch lebten.Nach dem Krieg formte sich in seinem Kopf ein Gedanke, der ihn immer noch trägt: „Ich wollte wichtig sein. Ich wollte nicht umsonst sterben“. Er nennt es ein fantastisches Wunder der Entschlossenheit, dass er sein Mathematik-Studium abschloss. Nachts stand er dafür mit einem Gewehr an der Schulter vor dem Haus eines Geheimdienstoffiziers. Tags fuhren ihn die Beamten mit ihren dicken Autos zur Uni.Der Fußball brachte M später zum Journalismus. Erst berichtete er über Sport, dann Menschenrechtsthemen und stieg schnell auf. Als Vorsitzender der Ruanda Media Company sollte er dann auf Geheiß Präsident Kagames die britische BBC abwickeln. M widersprach.Der Sicherheitsapparat in Ruanda reagierte. Verhöre, ein erzwungenes Geständnis und M fürchtete um sein Leben. Später in Brüssel schickte Kagame noch einmal seine Häscher. Aber FM blieb Journalist.Bei der Deutschen Welle will er Nachrichten aus der Sicht einfacher Leute zu erzählen. Aber für diese Bestimmung sterben, das will er nicht."

Mit festem Griff schiebt dieser Käufer seinen leeren Einkaufswagen weiter. Bis zu Gang vier klafft vor ihm dieses Drahtgestell, dann ein aufmerksamer Blick zu den Angeboten von Pfanni. Wache, flinke Augen blicken hinab in Richtung der grell roten Preisschilder. Aber dieser Konsument sucht etwas anderes.An der letzten Einfahrt macht er halt, dreht den Wagen und geht hinein. Langsamen Schrittes vorbei am Veltins und Paulaner und dann   dreht die Maske zu den aufgebahrten großen Gut und Günstig Wasserflaschen. Medium. Classic. Naturell. Schauen. Sehen. Abwägen. Denken. Wieder Schauen. Wieder Sehen.Zwei Schritte zur Seite. Noch mehr Wasser. Wieder Schauen. Sehen. Abwägen. Leicht den linken Stiefel anstellen, die Spitze anheben, Entscheidungshilfe nicht aus dem Bauch sondern aus den Füßen. Noch einmal rundherum um das Wasserregal. Preisvergleiche. Flaschenwald.Der Konsument sucht. Sucht nach Wasser. Vor einem Regal mit Flaschen. Teures Blackforrest, günstigeres Gerolsteiner, mit Geschmack, ohne. Und unten, ganz unten das Gut und Günstig.Der Konsument nimmt. Das gute und günstige von der Hausmarke. Ein Sixer der kleinen Flaschen, die mit roten Ettiketten. Für fünfzehn Cent pro Flasche, plus zehn Cent Pfand, erlöst sich dieser große, graue Konsument von seiner Suche.Das Weinregal bietet weitere Flaschen aber keine Antworten. An der Kasse klammert sich nur noch eine Synodyne Zahncreme an die sechs roten Punkte des Mineralwassers. Genervt schüttelt er den Kopf, weil die Konsumentin vor ihm so lange braucht, hier nach Kleingeld sucht, dort. Seinen Einkauf wird er kontaktlos bezahlen. Mit einer Apple Watch. Schnell und effizient.Kommentar:  Zu abstrakt mit den Vokabeln Konsument, Käufer  Zu langsam zur Action  Zu einfach Beginn und Ende gesetzt. Eingang/Ausgang des Supermarkts müssen nicht Anfang/Ende der Geschichte sein.  Langsamer Einstieg.  Blick beschreiben ist gefährlich  »Langssamen Schrittes«, was ist das?  Gute Pointen, gute Action, gute Satzkombinationen"

    "content": "In einer lauten Welt, die uns mit ihren persönlichen Erfolgen anschreit, bleibt eine ruhig und weise: Meine Oma, die mir die Sinne geöffnet und damit Demut beigebracht hat.Ich hab’ Streusel aus der weißen Rührschüssel stibizt, als du nicht hinsahst. An der hellen, hölzern gerahmten Arbeitsplatte hielt ich mich fest, stieg auf den schweren, roten Schemel und konnte deinen Fingern kaum folgen, wie sie flink die restlichen Streusel über dem ausgerollten Teig verteilten. Die kullerten dann in die hintersten Enden und äußersten Ränder und blieben manchmal erst neben dem Kuchen liegen.Ich dachte immer, du seist gefangen. Von einer Familie, einem herrschenden Mann, einer Kleinstadt, davon, keine Entscheidungen selbst getroffen zu haben. Ich dachte immer, du backst die Trauer über diesen Käfig hinein in die Süße der Streuselkuchen, überdeckst die harten Krusten der Krümel mit dem weichen Schleier der heißen Sahne. Ich dachte, ich wüsste was in dir ist, wie es außerhalb von mir ist.Und dann haben wir Opa in die Erde gelassen. Ich nahm deine Hand und sah auf zu dir, wie du stumm stand’st und mir dann leise ein Lächeln schenktest. Und ich konnte nicht verstehen, wer würde jetzt für dich entscheiden?Du schienst dann zu schrumpfen. Es war Sommer und wir standen in deinem Beet hinterm Haus, meine Augen auf deiner Höhe. Und du sagtest, vegetarisch hättest du kürzlich einen Nussbraten gebacken. Dann stieg mir dieser deftige Duft herzhaftester Nüsse, Sellerie und Möhren in Nase und Rachen und ich sog ihn in mich auf und legte ihn behutsam ab in meiner Vorratskammer der Sinne.Du blickst jetzt hoch zu mir, wenn du fragst, warum der Trump gewählt wurde. Dein Blick richtet sich durch die dicken Gläser deiner Brille hindurch zu mir und du fragst, was wir gegen die AfD noch tun können. Manchmal antworte ich was ich weiß und manchmal weiß ich es nicht. Ich versuche zuzuhören, dich nach deiner und damit meiner Geschichte zu befragen, in deinen Erinnerungen zu kramen, zu hören wie es für dich als Mädchen war und dass es nicht immer wie heute war.Und jetzt ziehst du aus, aus diesem Haus, das dir siebzig Jahre Zuflucht war. Damit reißen auch meine Erinnerungen ein und auch für mich geht diese Zuflucht zu Ende, ohne dass es jemals für mich war, wie es für dich gewesen ist. Auch wenn der Garten geht, bleiben uns die Streusel, die Möhren, die Nüsse.Ganz allein hast du entschieden in ein Heim zu gehen. Still. Ohne dich zu beraten. Ohne die Entscheidung an andere abzugeben. Denn du hast immer entschieden, wen du einlädst und über was wir sprechen. Was du tust, wohin du vereist und dass du anderen hilfst. Du hast nur nicht darüber gesprochen. Weil du mich eher riechen, fühlen und schmecken als hören und sehen gelehrt hast."

    "content": "Unten in der Schlucht breitet sich Beton aus. Harter, harter Beton. Hier und da schwirren ein paar Skater herum und oben am Rand steht Katja, beide Beine auf einem Skateboard. Das hintere hält das Brett an der Kante, das vordere hochgestellt schwebt mit der Spitze des Bretts über dem Abgrund. Kurz wird sie noch gehalten, dann lässt sie los, tritt fest nach vorne und stürzt sich hinab, mit dem Skateboard unter den Füßen in die Betonlandschaft.Mal wieder mutig sein, wollte sie. Und mit Mitte vierzig noch einmal Skaten lernen. »Na und dann stehst du da oben und schaust in diese Schlucht und sollst dich da runterstürzen.« Katja lacht, wenn sie erzählt. Ihre Augen leuchten, ihr ganzes Gesicht strahlt und erzählt vom Stolz der Überwindung.Seit vier Wochen skatet sie mit ihrem Sohn am Wochenende. Als sie sich zum ersten Mal traut in die Bowl — in der Skatersprache ist alles auf Englisch, erklärt sie — zu droppen, hat sie nur zwei kurze Übungsläufe hinter sich.Dann wagt sie sich an den hohen Abgrund und stürzt. Beim ersten Versuch und beim zweiten. Aber darum geht es: »Skateboarden hat mich gereizt, weil das nicht so leicht ist,« sagt die Journalistin. Früher war sie beim Vielseitigkeitsreiten häufiger mutig, doch dann kamen die Verpflichtungen sie durfte einfach nicht mehr kaputt gehen. Aber das Skaten muss man üben. Deshalb wartet auf Katja nächste Woche wieder die Betonschlucht."

    "content": "Ich fahre mit dem Fahrrad durch den Wedding und meine müde Muskelkraft treibt die schweren, unplattbaren Reifen Umdrehung für Umdrehung dem Kreuzberg entgegen. Es ist nachts. Vereinzelte Blechbüchsen rauschen an mir vorbei. Ich höre Deutschlandradio, wie früher, einfach einschalten und Inhalt. Es läuft Fazit, das Kulturmagazin, als ich einschalte und Gabi Wuttke spricht mit Jürgen Kaube über den soeben verstorbenen Literaturtheoretiker Karl Heinz Bohrer und darüber, dass es der Karl Heinz Bohrer gut fand, wenn jemand die Verhältnisse zum Tanzen bringt. Bohrer machte die geistige Erschütterung durch die Sprache als eine Energie aus, die ein Publikum aus der Gewöhnung austreten lässt. Erst dieses Ende der Langeweile bringt ihm zufolge den bürgerlichen Alltag durcheinander.Wir hatten keinen Zwang zum Ausstieg aus der Gewöhnung, keine Notwendigkeit Raumerfahrung zu vermitteln, als wir uns auf unser neues Wohnmodell einigten: Eine Dreizimmeraltbauwohnung mit Stuck, in bester Lage, einer sehr kleinen Küche, Balkon, drei gemeinsam Wohnenden und dem Manko der strukturellen Ungleichverteilung der Ausgangsbedingungen.Ein Zimmer ist klein und düster. Zwei andere sind groß und hell und zueinander Durchgangszimmer. Die Durchgangszimmer stehen gemeinsam auf, hören einander nicht zuletzt beim Fernsehen und verlangen offene Diskretion. Wie leben also drei Menschen in einer solchen Wohnung miteinander? Ein ökonomisches Allokationsproblem öffentlicher Güter:  Alle zahlen die gleiche Miete, bewohnen ein festes Zimmer und über die Dauer staut sich Unmut an.  Die Nachteile (Größe, Durchgang, Licht) werden im Preis reflektiert. Das helle, große, hintere Durchgangszimmer kann sich nur leisten wer erbt.  Eine Person zieht aus. Zwei verbleiben mit teurerer Miete und einer geschädigten Beziehung.  Umbaumaßnahme: Durchbruch vom hinteren Durchgangszimmer in den Flur. Statisch unmöglich.  Seit 19 Monaten rotieren wir durch die Zimmer. Zu Beginn monatlich, jetzt sobald eine:r der drei wechseln will. In diesem also wiederkehrenden Ritual räumen wir Betten und Schränke, manchmal auch Tische und Stühle, niemals aber Sofas und Bücherregale von hier nach dort und von dort nach dort, dekorieren die Wände um, sortieren aus und saugen an entlegenen Orten. Jedes Mal entstehen neue innenarchitektonische Formationen: Ein neuer Raumteiler hier, eine Büroecke dort, das Klavier ans Fenster oder die Pflanzen inszeniert. Das Bett unter die Hochebene, das Bett auf die Hochebene. Etwa zwei Stunden wird jeweils geräumt. Wir zahlen alle die gleiche Miete, teilen Vor- und Nachteile und lernen die Räume immer wieder neu kennen. Der regelmäßig unerwartete Ausbruch innerhalb der eigenen Wohnung durchbricht die langsame Verrostung jeglichen Wohnalltags. Die Verhältnisse tanzen ständig."

    "content": "Es fühle sich fremd an, sagst du, einen Buchstaben so weit hinten im Hals zu formen. Die Rachenmuskulatur zusammenzuziehen, anspannen, etwas Luft hindurchdrücken, dabei den Mund  öffnen, so dass ein »A«-Laut entsteht, der gequetscht klingt. Ein tiefes, gequetschtes »A«. Aber kein klares »A«, vor allem der Quetschlaut, verbindbar auch mit anderen Vokalen oder alleine klingend.Nicht nur fremd fühle er sich an. Er bereite geradezu Anstrengung. Du befürchtest, davon Muskelkater im Rachen zu bekommen. Und du versuchst es noch einmal: Du öffnest deinen Mund  und suchst die Muskulatur, die noch hinter der Kehle liegt. Hinter dem Ort, an dem du gurgelst, noch darunter, fühlst du einen Muskelkranz und spannst dort an. Wie beim Gurgeln presst du dann einen Ton zwischen den diesen Muskeln hindurch, ohne Flattern. Deine Uvula, dein  Zäpfchen, bleibt ruhig hängen und sieht sich deine Arbeit von oben aus an.Lockeres Drücken bringt diese Klangfarbe hervor. Auf Englisch gibt es stimmhafte pharyngale Frikative nicht, auch das Deutsche kennt sie kaum. Aber du willst Arabisch sprechen. Und, obwohl es anstrengende Tonarbeit im Hals ist, wird das ‘Ain, Schriftzeichen: ع, erst schön, wenn es schwerelos erklingt.  ع — [ʕ] […] as if you had opened your mouth under water and constricted your throat to prevent choking and then released the constriction with a sighDein Selbstversuch unter der Dusche endet in wüstem Verschlucken und Husten. Wer übernimmt eine so gefährliche Anleitung in ein Lehrbuch? Nein, du brauchst diese theoretischen Anleitungen nicht. Du kennst den Laut bereits.Du kennst die deutschen Dialekte, hast mit den Lauten gespielt, die Register gezogen und früh die Vielfalt möglicher Laute kennen gelernt. Dir stehen die tiefen Rachenanspannungen eines Niederbayrischen »yuoah mai« zur Verfügung, dieser Aussprache des anerkennenden Desintresses, für das du nach dem »y«-Laut in der Kehle tiefer rutscht und den Rachen aktivierst und durch leichtes Pressen Richtung »oah« entspannst.Du ziehst auch für die schwäbische Betonung deiner Erstplatzierung in »I bin d’ e’rschde« deinen Rachen zusammen. Das »R« versinkt so weiter hinten im Rachen, als es im Hochdeutschen der Fall wäre. Auch dieses Schwäbische »R« ist ein pharyngaler Konsonant. Du kennst die Übung also.Aber dieses arabische ‘Ain sitzt noch tiefer im Schlund. Es bricht aus der Tiefe des Rachens hervor und spiegelt damit nach Ahmad al Farahidi den ersten Laut, die essentielle Stimme und die eigentliche Seele wider. Der arabische Gelehrte des achten Jahrhunderts verfasste das erste arabische Wörterbuch. In seinem Alphabet machte das ‘Ain den Anfang. Die weitere Reihenfolge folgte der Lautbildung nach vorn im Mund, bis zum mit der Spitze der Lippen gehauchten M.Deine Pharyngalerfahrung wird sich also erweitern. Aber deine eigene Sprache enthält bereits die Vielfalt, um im Gegenspiel des Lauteformens mitzuspielen. Und wie bei einem Spiel wirst du weiter üben. Denn noch würgst du Wörter endend mit ‘Ain höflich aus dem Hals."

    "content": "Wenn sich früher über Land zwei Jogger entgegenkamen, war es üblich zu Grüßen. Ein Fingerzeig, eine gehobene Hand, ein Nicken, vielleicht sogar ein ländliches ›Servus‹. Zwischen Gerste und Roggen entstand so dieser kurze Moment der Zweisamkeit, wenn man sich begegnete, die Hand kurz hob, während sie dann wieder nach hinten fiel, dem gleichmäßigen Stoßen und Ziehen der Jogginghandbewegung folgend.Man grüßte eher nicht, wenn man überholt wurde oder jemanden überholte. Es gab dieses ungeschriebene Gesetz, dass die Überhol-Schmach nicht auch noch durch einen Gruß markiert werde. Es wurde still und leise überholt. Außer dieses eine Mal, als mir ein vorbeiziehender Rentner bescheinigte, er sei in diesem Alter den Alten davongelaufen.Nach Feldern, einem Wald und entlang eines Flusses führte der letzte Weg meiner Runde damals immer durch ein Wohngebiet. Zurück in der Zivilisation ließ das Gegrüße nach. Zwischen Autos und spielenden Kinden waren auch hier noch manche Jogger unterwegs. Aber je näher an anderem Verkehr, je näher einer Haustüre, desto weniger Jogger-Servus.Später ließ das Grüßen nach. In der Universitätsstadt dachte ich noch, es läge an den vielen Joggern; man käme ja gar nicht mehr heraus aus dem Grüßen. In den Großstädten wurde dann gar nicht mehr beim Joggen gegrüßt. Nun lief man sich unbewegt entgegen. Andere Läufer blieben schlicht eins mit der Masse der Verkehrsteilnehmenden.In der Zeit habe ich so manche irritierten Blicke gesammelt, die meine unvermittelten Grüße auslösten, und wie Schätze verwahrt. Bis zu diesem einen Tag.Es war ein Mittwoch im Sommer und nach drei langen und heißen Wochen regnete es seit um vier Uhr morgens. Mal mehr mal weniger. Die Stadtoberen hatten einen Waschtag beschlossen, zu dem die Luft wieder vollständig hergestellt werden sollte, die Grünflächen gewässert, die Kanalisation überfordert. Im Innenhof konnte ich den Regen mal eher von rechts, dann zeitweise stark von links kommen sehen.Elf Stunden hatte ich dem Regen gelauscht, dann musste ich los. Auf nassen Gehwegplatten, vorbei an kauernden Regenschirmen, hinein in den spärlich besuchten Park. Keine Jogger weit und breit. Dann über die Straße, am Sportplatz entlang, hinein in den nächsten Park.Eine Stunde Sport. Zwei andere Jogger. Zweimal sehr freundlich und enthusiastisch gegrüßt, selbst gegrüßt, zurückgegrüßt, gegrüßt worden. Sogar ohne mein Zutun wäre hier gegrüßt worden.Und da war er wieder. Dieser kurze Moment der Zweisamkeit. Du gehörst dazu. Und du auch. Wir laufen doch alle in den selben nassen Turnschuhen, sagen diese Grüße. Ja, auch ich laufe jetzt geradewegs durch Pfützen. Toll, dass du es rausgeschafft hast. Weiter so. Ein kurzer Moment der Zweisamkeit, der erst in der Einsamkeit entsteht."

    "content": "Ich kann mich jetzt schon kaum noch an dieses eigenartige Gefühl von gestern um etwa fünf Uhr morgens erinnern. Dann war es mir so neu, so ungewohnt, so ungewöhnlich vorgekommen. Jetzt schon gehört es wieder zum Reportoir. Seit zwei Wochen liege ich nachts auf meinem Lager, bestehend aus einem Futon und einem Kissen. Decken sind seit kürzlich nicht nur überflüssig, sogar hinderlich geworden bei dem Versuch in Seesternstellung keine Hautpartie in der Nähe einer anderen Hautpartie zu spüren; So, dass nicht einmal die glühende Aura und der Schweisfilm des eigenen Körpers dem eigenen Körper nahe kommt.Häufig vergebens, dennoch auf dem Rücken liegend, ständig in der Hoffnung leicht zu schweben, sodass weniger Schweiß in den Futon einsinkt, nicht diese kleine, ständig wachsende Pfütze sich wie ein Leck unter meinen Lenden bildet.Seit zwei Wochen bin ich ein Seestern. Und dann gestern das überraschende Gefühl. Ein leichtes Frösteln gegen fünf Uhr morgens. Zuerst kaum zuordenbar, was hat mich da sanft aber bestimmt aus dem Schlaf gezogen? Welche körperliche Sensation umspielt meine Sinne?Vom Innenhof her tropft seit einer Woche die erste Briese durch den Vorhang herein. Die körperkühlende Funktion des Schweises feiert ihren Triumpf, weckt mich dafür sogar auf und sagt: Siehst du, Schwitzen kühlt eben doch.Nach zwei längeren Regengüssen ist dieses leichte Frösteln wieder in den Fundus erwartbarer Sensationen übergegangen. Ich habe wieder eine leichte Sommerdecke bezogen und bin nicht mehr allein im Bett. Die Hitze lähmt nicht mehr. Das fröhliche Frösteln bringt Kontakte wieder. Haut an Decke. Haut an Haut. Das fröhliche Frösteln beendet die Einsamkeit."

    "content": "Durch den Rheinauhafen glitzert die Abendsonne. In ganz Köln lockt heute eine einzige Kulturveranstaltung. Short Story Night, fünf Kurzgeschichten, gelesen von echten Autor:innen, die mit dem Wind und der Mikrofoneinstellung kämpfen. Für alle ist der Ton etwas leise und niemand kann einfach für sich etwas lauter drehen. Eine von uns ruft schon bald laut LAUTER.Fünfzehnt Euro Eintritt, negativer Corona-Test und festgelegte Sitzplätze, etwas der Tischbühne entrückt. Keine direkte Sicht ins Gesicht der Lesenden, der Blickwinkel eher von oben herab, auf den ganzen sprechenden Menschen, inklusive der Beine.Die Sitzplätze sind auf steinernen Rängen markiert, zwei Polster pro Person. Die Ränge reichen zum Wasser hinab. Eine Sichtbetonwand fasst Ränge und Wasser ein. Niedrige Geländer trennen die Ränge von einem Weg entlang der Wand.Unser Blick schweift noch durch den Raum, sieht Spaziergänger auf den Wegen entlang schlendern. Wir lauschen den Geschichten, sie genießen den Abend.Während der ersten Kurzgeschichte bleiben Passant:innen länger stehen und spitzen die Ohren. Mit der zweiten Kurzgeschichte lassen sich außerhalb der Balustrade Hörer:innen nieder. Mittlerweile hört eine Mutter die restlichen Geschichten des Abends von außerhalb, stillt. Der Begleiter entpackt Getränke. Die beiden sind dabei. Ohne Eintrittsgeld, ohne markierten Sitzplatz, auf einem der Wege, die die Ränge einfassen. Vor der Balustrade haben sie Platz genommen, sehen durch das Geländer hindurch, lauschen dem über Lautsprecher übertragenen Ton.Wir sitzen hier im Innen, auf markierten Sitzplätzen mit Test, mit Eintrittskarte, mit Zugang zur Bar. Wir sitzen im reinlichen Innen, dessen Hygieneregeln das Tragen einer Maske auf dem Weg zur Toilette vorschreiben. Sie sitzen im Außen auf dem harten Boden der Wirklichkeit, frei zu gehen und zu bewegen. Keine Hygieneregeln, keine Aufsicht, kein Eintrittsgeld.Wenn wir genau hinsehen, dann fühlt es sich an, als streckten sie uns geradewegs die Zunge heraus: Unsere Festlegung auf den Termin, unseren Wunsch nach flauschig-weichen Sitzpolstern und unsere Eintrittsgelder verlachend. Wenn wir noch genauer hinsehen, dann bemerken wir diese Gelassenheit derer dort draußen. Zufrieden über den glücklichen Zufall, spontan einer Lesung beiwohnen zu können, voller Dankbarkeit gegenüber den Organisator:innen, ohne Erwartungen und Ansprüche.Wie wir nach den Zaungästen lechzen, sie bewundern. Wie die Zaungäste uns provozieren. Wie die Zaungäste die Grenzen des Raums verschwimmen lassen. Wo Innen und Außen ist, wird diffus. Der Ton lässt sich nicht einfangen. Wie die Zaungäste in Frage stellen, was richtig und falsch ist, wie Teilhabe funktioniert.An- oder abwesend, Getestet oder nicht getestet, bezahlt oder nicht bezahlt, stumm gestellt oder Kamera an. Zaungäste können einfach gehen, getestet sein, hinterher freiwillig spenden und ungefragt dazwischen quatschen. Ist die Zaungastschaft nicht Rebellion?"

    "content": "Der März 2020 hätte als Krise globaler Finanzmärkte Geschichte machen können. Doch in der Öffentlichkeit wenig bekannte »Swap-Lines« verhinderten einen Börseneinbruch. Zum Ende der Regierungszeit Trump kooperierten dabei Zentralbanken der Staaten des G7-Verbundes und die Schweiz.Im März 2020 fehlten plötzlich eine halbe Billionen Dollar. Wegen des neuartigen Virus verkauften Börsenhändler weltweit Öl, Aktien, Anleihen und Derivate. Da alle verkauften und niemand kaufte, brachen die Kurse ein. Am 9. März allein fiel der Ölpreis um 30 Prozent, die Risikoprämie für Dollar stieg um 500 Prozent.So fehlten auf einmal US-Dollar in Handelsplätzen in Japan, Europa und Finanzzentren wie Shanghai oder London. Um zu verstehen, wie Zentralbanken dieses Ungleichgewicht behoben, lohnt sich ein Schritt zurück. Denn die Währung fehlte in sogenannten Offshore-Märkten, einem wenig beachteten, jedoch für globale Lieferketten unabdingbaren Handelsplatz für kurzfristige Kredite.Märkte mit einem ProblemDas Wort »offshore« erinnert an Windparks im Meer. Bezogen auf Geld bezeichnet es jedoch Währungen außerhalb des Zuständigkeitsbereichs einer Zentralbank. »Offshore-Dollar bedeutet, dass Geld und andere Finanzprodukte wie Anleihen und Verbriefungen auf US-Dollar lautend geschöpft werden, aber außerhalb der USA«, sagt der deutsche Ökonom Dr. Steffen Murau. Er forscht derzeit an der renommierten Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich (BIS).Experten der BIS schätzen, dass heute etwa 1,8 Billionen Dollar in diesen Märkten zirkulieren. Die genaue Messung gestalte sich jedoch schwierig. »Es kommt darauf an, wie man Offshore-Währung definiert. Derivate könnten zum Beispiel Teil davon sein, werden jedoch nicht in Bilanzen erfasst«, erklärt Murau.Wenn also ein Lebensversicherer in Tokio von einem Geldmarktfonds in Singapur über Nacht Dollar leiht, könnte der Fonds die Dollar selbst von einer schweizerischen Investmentbank mit Sitz in London geliehen haben. Tokio hinterlegt dabei US-Staatsanleihen als Sicherheit, Singapur hinterlegt Euro aus einem anderen Kreditgeschäft. 24 Stunden später werden Teile der Geschäfte rückabgewickelt, Teile fortgeschrieben und andere Teile mit anderen Geschäftspartnern neu abgeschlossen.Dies ist die Welt der Offshore-Geldmärkte. Sie bewegen schnell große Summen um die Erde und haben ein Problem: Für Kreditausfälle gibt es keine Garantien. Eigentlich sind Geldmärkte mit Sicherheiten der Zentralbank ausgestattet. Die Institute schaffen bei einer Kreditklemme zusätzliche Währung und verleihen diese an Banken. Aber jede Notenbank kann nur ihre eigene Währung drucken. Banken, die also außerhalb der USA mit Dollar handeln, sind für diese Geschäfte also nicht versichert.»Das internationale Finanzsystem hängt vom US-Dollar ab. Und manchmal gibt es Zeiten und Orte wo es sehr schwer wird Dollar herzubekommen«, sagt Nathan Sheets. Er war bis 2011 Chef der Abteilung für Internationales Finanzwesen bei der US-Zentralbank Federal Reserve. In der Finanzkrise 2007/08 entwickelte er einen Mechanismus, um das Problem zu beheben. Im März 2020 kam es wieder zur Anwendung.In der letzten Krise entwickeltDie letzte globale Finanzkrise braute sich fernab der Küsten der Vereinigten Staaten in den Wogen der Dollarmärkte europäischer Finanzinstitute zusammen. Spätestens als die französische BNP Paribas im August 2007 zwei ihrer Dollar-Geldmarktfonds schließen musste, kündigte sich eine Klemme an.US-Notenbänker Sheets schlug »Swap-Lines« als Abhilfe vor. Die US-Zentralbank vergibt dabei einen kurzfristigen Dollar Überbrückungskredit an Partnerzentralbanken, den Letztere an Banken in ihrem Zuständigkeitsbereich weiterverleihen. So werden Dollar in Offshore-Märkte vermittelt.Neben den unbegrenzten Swap-Lines (unten rechts) vergibt die Federal Reserve 2008 und 2020 noch neun weitere, unbegrenzte Dollar Kreditlinien — Grafik: Mathis RichtmannKurz vor Weihnachten 2007 vergab das oberste Entscheidungsgremium der Federal Reserve die ersten solcher Swap-Lines. So konnte die Europäische Zentralbank maximal 20 und die Schweizerische Nationalbank 4 Milliarden Dollar an ihre Banken vermitteln.Im September 2008 forderte der Fed Präsident Ben Bernanke dann größere Geschütze. Am Tag nach der Lehmann Pleite schlug er vor, seine Kompetenzen bei der Vergabe von Swap-Linien auszuweiten: »Ich würde es bevorzugen, wenn sie keine Kreditobergrenzen hätten, damit ich weiß, dass ich meine ganz eigene Bazooka habe«, sagte Bernanke. Die versammelten Notenbänker lachten und stimmten zu, so ist es im Protokoll vermerkt.Diese damit unbegrenzten Kreditvolumina signalisierten, dass für offshore Märkte die ganze Macht der US Federal Reserve bereitstehe. Weitere Partnerzentralbanken folgten und im Dezember 2008 liehen sich ausländische Zentralbanken in einer Woche insgesamt 580 Milliarden Dollar von der US-Notenbank.Das Sicherheitsnetz bleibt im EinsatzGemeinsam mit anderen Krisenbekämpfungsprogrammen, stellte die Federal Reserve im März 2010 auch die Swap-Lines ein – bis zwei Monate später Jean-Claude Trichet, damals EZB-Präsident, Bernanke telefonisch um Wiederaufnahme bat. Zu Beginn der Eurokrise sorgten sich die Europäer nämlich wieder um die Offshore-Geschäfte ihrer Banken.»Wir waren damals gerade in Basel bei der Bank für Internationalen Zahlungsausgleich«, erinnert sich Sheets, »Bernanke rief mich an und sagte, ich solle mal bei den anderen Zentralbänkern, die beim letzten Mal dabei waren anklopfen und fragen, ob sie wieder mitmachen.« Der Architekt der Swap-Lines drehte also eine Runde im Obergeschoss des 20-stöckigen Turms der BIS am Baseler Hauptbahnhof und erntete begeisterte Zustimmung. So entstand das G7+Schweiz-Netzwerk aus Federal Reserve, Schweizerischer Nationalbank und Europäischer, Englischer, Kanadischer und Japanischer Zentralbank – damals noch auf Zeit.Seit Oktober 2013 besteht das Netzwerk dauerhaft. »Vor der Krise herrschte noch der Konsens in Zentralbanken, dass wir uns möglichst wenig in Märkte einmischen sollten. Das hat sich geändert. Mit den Swap-Lines war das ähnlich. Nach einer Weile hatten sich alle daran gewöhnt und konnten sagen, dass die einfach notwendig sind«, sagt Sheets. Die Zentralbänker erwiesen damit Weitblick.Der Großteil der Dollarliquidität ging im Frühjahr 2020 nach Japan und Europa — Grafik: Alexander ValchyshenAls im März 2020 globale Lieferketten zusammenbrachen, taumelte der Offshore-Markt erneut. Wegen der neuartigen Pandemie waren Geldmarktfonds nicht bereit, Dollar zu verleihen. Zwar wussten Wertpapierhändler um das Swap-Line-Netzwerk. Jedoch waren bisher nur fünf Zentralbanken an die Federal Reserve angeschlossen. Was würde aus Offshore-Händlern in Brasilien, Dänemark, Australien oder Singapur werden?Um die Situation unter Kontrolle zu bekommen, vergab das FOMC zweitweise Swap-Lines an bis zu 14 Partnerzentralbanken. Denn Offshore-Märkte sind über den ganzen Erdball verzweigt und nur durch enge Kooperation entlastbar. Die rasche Intervention füllte die Lücke der fehlenden halben Billionen US-Dollar und stattete Händler mit Garantien aus. Die chinesische Zentralbank hingegen ließ die US-Notenbank außen vor. Nathan Sheets sagt dazu ironisch: »die haben ja auch mehr Dollar als die Fed«, lachend fügt der US-Zentralbänker hinzu: »aber das ist nur einer von zwei Gründen.«"

You simply download one of their skeletons and have a website running in your Finder because you can run  php -S localhost:8003 system/router.php in Terminal and point your browser to localhost:8003 and the website is there. Later you push this folder onto your Apache webserver, done.This website also uses Grav. One of the reasons is that I need to run the system myself that I wish to use in other projects. Otherwise I’m no help in support questions. I know Wordpress fairly well and have built numberous websites with it. But Grav with its flat file structure just feels so much more up to date than mySQL databases.So here I encounter smaller obstacles in enhancing this site. I use a macbook pro and code in Sublime Text 3. I can just so much recommend Sublime Text. Especially for the flat-file structure its sidebar is great help.Being able to build right through running a apache server on your mac, makes developing fun. That way I can code on the train even if there’s no wifi. Its just a bummer I can’t google for help then."

    "content": "One thing the central bank cannot do: Refuse market sentiment.Novelties in central banking since 2007/08 have seen much discussion. But the  introduction of somewhat overlooked permanent central bank liquidity  swap lines can shed a light onto future monetary policy, such as a  standing repo facility.The lines were first introduced in December 2007, when the Fed and the ECB  and the Fed and the SNB swapped currencies so that the off-shore central banks could provide their banks with greenbacks. The Fed extended this  facility in the turmoil of 2008 but most importantly the feature became a permanent backstop to Eurodollar markets in October 2013.The swap lines that the Fed set up with the Bank of England, European  Central Bank, Swiss National Bank, Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada  (together the C6) now are unlimited, permanent and reciprocal.  Furthermore, all participating central banks share the same agreements  amongst each other. European and Japanese banks are using the dollar  allotments at their respective central banks on a weekly basis, albeit  at small amounts. And the BoE in March of 2019 drew on this agreement  when it activated its line with the ECB.Image from Bahaj, Reis (2019)Ad-hoc international lending of last resort was already common before  financial journalist and monetary theorist, Walter Bagehot, urged  central banks to provide liquidity during a squeeze. Take, for instance, the case of winter 1857 when the Austrian National Bank sent a train  carriage full of silver to the free city of Hamburg. The Hansestadt had  been running very low on silver reserves. A liquidity crisis there saw  merchants unwilling to clear their shipments. Anecdotal reference holds, that as the train arrived and took a turn through the city, trust was  re-established and money changed hands again.The example with missing silver in Hamburg but excess silver in Vienna  exemplifies what happened in the 2007/08 Eurodollar squeeze. European  banks that had funded their dollar portfolios short-term saw a hike in  funding costs after French bank BNP Paribas closed access to three of  its hedge funds. These increased costs meant a liquidity crisis for  European banks, as they were able to access Euros, but not dollars, from the ECB.Swap lines between central banks fixed this issue from December 2007  onwards. That the network of swap lines between six central banks became permanent in 2013 fixed the missing backstop to Eurodollar markets and  put a cap on funding costs.Three lessons for broader monetary policy can be learned by studying the process that led to the 2013 decision.First, who is part of the major-currency backstop-club is a question of  geopolitics. Most studies on swap lines by political economists find  that alignment with US interests of capital account openness or exposure of US financial institutions were key determinants on whether Emerging Market central banks received a Fed swap line during the crisis. The C6 club, however, was less  formed by economic determinants or foreign policy preferences. As a  former Fed official tasked with setting up the swap line network again  during the wake of the Eurocrisis in 2011 told me, the Bank of Canada  for one was simply included because they had been part of the club  before. No further questions asked. The previous institutional setting  was simply sticky, a facet of the international financial architecture  which the Amsterdam political economist Marieke de Goede calls „frozen  power structures“.Third, the facility became permanent, once the market simply expected it to be there. Initially, swap-lines were introduced to reduce stress in the  market and create certainty about funding. Reassuring markets also  featured as the main concern when Fed staff moved a decision on  prolonging temporary swap-lines to an earlier meeting. They were  concerned that “as the deadline grew closer, the markets would start to  worry about whether the swap-line was going to be there or not,“ as one  of the designers of the tool, Nathan Sheets, argued in 2010. Swap lines  were extended again and again because “allowing the swap-lines to expire would seem to create unnecessary risks,“ as Brian Sack, then manager  of the New York Open Market Account, put it. In October 2013 the same  argument was used to justify the permanent introduction of the feature.  Staff to the FOMC contended that standing lines would “reduce  uncertainty among market participants as to whether and when these  arrangements would be renewed and would limit the risk that decisions  regarding the renewal of these arrangements would be misinterpreted.”These three lessons shed light on the debated standing repo facility. Former NY Fed chairman Bill Dudley now calls for such a tool that updates the lender of last resort facility to current market environments. Just as liquidity swap lines cap deviations from covered interest parity, a permanent Fed repo would cap repo rates. And just like swap lines  solve dislocations in Eurodollar funding, the Fed repo counters  pass-through issues with domestic reserves.If decision-making follows the in the same vein as it did with the swap  lines, the standing repo facility will be there soon, just as analysts  at Deutsche Bank and Citi have already argued last year. The Fed has intervened again and again and tasked the trading desk at  the NY Fed to do so „until instructed otherwise“. The market will soon  simply expect it to be there. It will then be more costly for the Fed to dismantle the facility than to perpetuate it. And just like with swap  lines, Fed officials will warm to the understanding presented by Dudley: The Fed earns on Treasury holdings more than it pays on reserves issued to banks. And lastly, a standing repo facility will perpetuate power  structures within International Finance. Choosing the five partners for  the C6 swap lines followed a momentum of old Basel Club friends. The  backstop to the repo market will strengthen the position of US primary  dealers vis-à-vis money market participants elsewhere."

    "content": "My dissertation at LSE was titled “From Bazooka to Backstop: The Emergence of a Permanent International Lender of Last Resort”. In it, I explain how it came to be that in 2013 six major central banks decided to implement what some now call the C6 liquidity swap line network. Arguably, this is a permanent International Lender of Last Resort. I draw on arguments by Claude Lévi-Strauss to argue that central bankers design institutions by bricolage. They craft international institutions not so much in a rationalist, forward looking way but rather creatively re-deploy existing means.You can find an outline of the dissertation below. The text itself and a link to a presentation on the topic are linked below that.  Permanent domestic discount window lending has been established since at least the 20th century as a core feature the central bank provides. We have also historically witnessed numerous cases of temporary international lending of last resort (ILOLR) between sovereign central banks. A permanent backstop to international Eurodollar markets has long been debated and sought for but remained technically impossible (Fischer 1999). The emergence of a permanent ILOLR in the shape of the C6 liquidity swap lines therefore begs explanation. The six major central banks since 2013 uphold this new institution of monetary cooperation through which they provide liquidity to each other at unlimited amounts. My work draws on work by the anthropologist Lévi-Strauss (1966) and understands the emergence of this international backstop as a ‘design by bricolage’. Therefore, central bankers followed a (1) dialectical process of agency and structure and (2) creatively re-deployed tools that existed previously. The C6 network therefore is no perfect solution and prone to instability. The presented work thus expands on ‘infrastructural entanglement’ (Braun 2018) of central banks in financial markets and makes the precise practices (Schatzki, Knorr-Cetina, and von Savigny 2001) visible that constrain and enable central bankers’ decision making.

    "content": "Why would the ECB sustain British banks’ LiFE?One little detail in the recent Brexit turmoil has been overlooked:  Invoking an agreement between six central banks from 2013, the Bank of  England in March activated its bilateral liquidity swap line with the European Central Bank. This technicality means, that British  banks from now onwards will be able to obtain Euros directly from the  Old Lady of Threadneedle Street. Tellingly, the Bank of England calls  this new measure “LiFE”: Liquidity Facility in Euros.Photo by Christian Wiediger on UnsplashThis is odd in three ways: First, while Theresa May tries to sever the ties  with the mainland, the unelected officials at the Bank of England  strengthen them. Second, while British central bankers do not explicitly say so, the timing lets me (and others) assume this measure is intended to mitigate money market stress in case of a no-deal or bad-deal Brexit. That the ECB is willing to lend out  Euros to British banks by way of the BoE doesn’t directly seem to be  motivated by price-stability concerns. Put differently: Why would the  ECB help out the BoE and is this help within the ECB’s mandate? Third,  this measure points towards an inherent tension: While for example  British importers will face higher costs due to the current uncertainty, the island’s banks enjoy certainty with respect to their euro-funding  costs. While this may be justified by the central role of the banking  system within an economy, this instance highlights the explicit  preferential treatment of banks which apparently don’t have “to get fit for Brexit” because they have a backstop.Why are standing swap facilities different?For context, in the financial crisis the US Federal Reserve established so-called liquidity swap lines with a whole range of central banks around the world. In swapping their currency for dollars with the Fed, those other central banks could lend out dollars in their jurisdictions. The measure was intended to  alleviate money market stress. All of these lines were subsequently  ended again. Arguably, this lending of last resort backstopped the  Eurodollar market. Historically speaking such international lending of  last resort is quite common: Central banks have emergency-lent to each other gold or silver for numerous times in the 19th century. And the Fed and the US Treasury lending out dollars to Mexico in the mid 1990s is a recent such  example.What made 2013 different was that six central banks declared standing  facilities of bilateral swap agreements to be present until further  notice. With not immediate crisis, lending facilities would simply be  there to use. Participating central banks are the Fed, the European  Central Bank, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, Swiss National Bank and  Bank of Canada. Especially the dollar line with the Fed is of interest  because it has been active all the time. Dollar auctions are for example held at the ECB weekly and banks have made use of this every week since.There is an increasing body of literature on Lender of Last Resort facilities in the Great Financial Crisis. What the March 5th announcement of the  Bank of England highlights is that these facilities are far from being a “last resort”. They are not just ad-hoc put in place to deal with a  crisis but rather there to alleviate stress before the crisis emerges.Its international discount window lending!Ricardo Reis and Salem Bahaj argue, that the facility essentially creates discount window lending in a foreign currency and thus puts a ceiling on deviations of Covered Interest Parity (the basis). From a central banker’s perspective the feature is quite nice. With the Bank of England’s concern for financial stability it is easy to see why being able to lend Euros to its banks is handy when nobody is clear how future relations with Euro-governments will look like in the  foreseeable future. It reduces contingency. And with Bahaj actually  being employed at the Bank of England presently, they have in-house  knowledge activating this feature puts a ceiling on funding cost  deviations between the Pound and the Euro. This is beneficial for  British banks in terms of competitiveness with European banks and  lessens liquidity risks.But what’s the political economy here? Democracy, Legality, Interest-groupsThese are aspects of economics. In terms of political economy, though, I have struggled so far to grasp this institutional innovation. This is why  looking at the just recently activated swap line between the Bank of  England and the ECB is interesting.I have outlined above three oddities that arise from a political economy  reading of the situation and will address them in turn. They are  essentially structured by the themes of democracy, legality and  interest-groups. It may also be important to note that I do not take  umbrage with the facility (and even if I did nobody would care). I would just like to point to seeming oddities.First, while it is government policy to get out of the European Union, the  Bank of England strengthens integration with the European Central Bank.  Prima facie, this only highlights features of global financialization: “the integration of previously national money markets and capital markets”.While “getting out of the EU” doesn’t mean “getting the Euro out of Great  Britain” I argue at least on an institutional level a link between  central banks was permanently activated that wasn’t there before. This  mostly points towards the tension between democracy and central bank  independence. With the latter being a tool of globalized finance,  decisions that are “good” for the economy can be made without government policy interfering. The Independent puts it differently:  It means that even if the UK crashes out of the EU without a deal, the country will still remain reliant on Frankfurt to help safeguard the financial system.Second, I am sure the European Central Bank did its legal checks when going  forward with the standing facilities in 2013. But the ECB’s mandate asks it to provide price stability for the Eurozone. Within this narrow  reading there is no clear indication how backstopping the British  banking sector is justified. On the other hand, stress in the British  market would possibly spillover to the Eurozone. Then, the facility  promotes financial stability in the ECB’s jurisdiction. This  institutional evolution towards financial stability is at least  interesting with regards to current discussions on changing the ECB’s mandate.There would be the argument that maintaining the active swap-line with the  BoE comes at no cost for the ECB. It reduces the question why permanent  liquidity swap lines emerged in 2013 to a “why wouldn’t they?”.Photo by Michael Jasmund on UnsplashThird, I would like to point to the tension of interest groups. It is clear  that distortions in money market funding would further ripple through  the British economy and the active Euro-line may mitigate such risks.  But living in London at the moment I daily pass by advertisements from  the government pushing businesses to get ready for Brexit. This clearly  also applies to banks. They surely, too have to get a lot of work done  in this regard. But they won’t have to hoard Euros to remain liquid. On  the other hand the UK’s largest supplier of toilet paper stockpiles its main asset. Again, I’m not disagreeing with the policy. But it clearly shows who is treated preferentially. Then again, I am sure the ECB would be happy to supply toilet paper and swap it for Pounds if it came for free to the  ECB. And whats worse, no Euros or no toilet paper?"

    "content": "Workshop zur Vermittlung geldtheoretischer ZusammenhängeOb eine Finanzinstitution illiquide oder insolvent ist, stellt eine recht weit greifende Unterscheidung dar. Herkömmliche Krisenerklärungen fokussieren darauf, das Banken oder andere Institute nach ihrer Insolvenz „durch Steuerzahlerinnen gerettet“ werden mussten. Dies schließt in der Darstellung Praktiken aus, die auf die kurzfristige Bereitstellung von Liquidität durch Zentralbanken zum Ziel haben. Bis heute ist die Diskussion anhaltend, ob die Krise der Zahlungsunfähigkeit 2008 eine Liquiditäts- oder Solvenzkrise war. Beide Konzepte sind Formen der Zahlungsunfähigkeit. Ich habe dazu auch einen einen Blogeintrag bei Medium verfasst.Die Teilnehmenden erhalten Kurzbeschreibungen von Szenen. Diese stellen jeweils einen Fall von Insolvenz oder Illiquidität dar. Die Teilnehmenden wählen selbst eine Form der Darstellung ihrer Szene und präsentieren diese im Plenum.  Zielgruppe: Ab Sekundarstufe II, von mir durchgeführt mit Schülerinnen und Schülern 9.-11. Klasse  Dauer: 110 Minuten  Vorwissen: Kein Vorwissen, Vertiefungsmethode  Ziel: Vertiefung von Begriffen  Methodik: Szenische Darstellung, Theaterpädagogik  Moderation: -Die ersten drei Szenen beschreiben Probleme der Illiquidität. Nur die Szene der Geschäftsidee stellt einen Fall der Insolvenz dar. Die Methode zeigt auf, dass wir individuell Insolvenz kaum verstehen, da es ein rechtliches Konstrukt aus der Geschäftswelt ist. Insofern liegen Betrachtungen der letzten Finanzkrise als Krise der Illiquidität recht nah.Folgendes Video ist als Ergebnis einer Gruppenarbeit am Otto-Hahn-Gymnasium Göttingen bei Projekttagen „Was kracht wenn die Börse kracht?“ entstanden.

    "content": "We have let finance to those who know about it. We should, though, discuss the details of the financial fabric around us and push it into  political agenda.My generation hears the word crisis everywhere. But what do we make of  that in political terms? Do we have the vocabulary and perspectives to  describe our realities? Photo by Robert Metz on UnsplashIt will be ten years after Lehman went bust this fall. There are many  thoughts about this. One of my reocurring ones is: Do we know what  happened? And with that I don’t mean “we”, the ones who are interested  in repos, liquidity coverage ratios, financial-stability-currency-swap  kind of nerds, but normal people, who have not as a job to read research or finance related literature on a frequent basis.Gladly, I am involved in the process to create educational material on “Ten  years after the crash” for age groups upper middle and high school. We  try to come up with engaging, maybe playful, but definitely thoughtful  educational methods to be used in schools. We have an activity that will draw students in, engage in such an abstract topic as economics in  their daily lives. Like, “What could you buy with one Euro, or with ten? And what with a stock that is worth ten Euro?” or, we talk about bank  bailout packages and try to build reference for what building a local  soccer field or repairs in their schools would cost. We offer newspaper  articles for discussion in reference to our constitutional law and how  house evictions could be seen under such a perspective.This work is very engaging. I constantly have to boil down, think again and  discuss how we perceive reality. And that is what I mean by saying: Do we know what happened?What happens when a bank goes bustWe have for example an activity that intends to explain what a  bank-insolvency is. We draw up how balance sheets work, how maybe a  student in school has a deposit account and their parents a mortgage on  their home. And then we explain what happens to that bank if loan  repayments are missed. Now, at this point our activity focusses on  losses on equity of the bank and it thus becoming insolvent. And this is what happened essentially in Germany, where Commerzbank after trying to buy Dresdner Bank had a terrible cough and just with the help of  government intervention could bolster its capital cushion enough to  remain solvent.I wasn’t part of the team planning this activity, that I now like very  much. It tries to explain in very hands-on ways what a bank-insolvency  is.I, on the other hand, had thought of the crisis differently: I had looked  only at a couple of months earlier than the Commerzbank incident. I had  in my thoughts of what happened in the financial crisis only looked at  the funding crisis that crushed Lehman. I had only taken the angle of a  liquidity crisis. I had heard Perry Mehrling speak, read Minsky and used their writing, as well as, “the run on repo” as lecture material. Thus, in the activity we have on solvency of a bank, I was a little uneasy. Does it really explain what happened? Should we rather focus on the solvency or the liquidity aspect of the crisis?Some insights into liquidity vs. solvencyAnd now I am extremely glad that I made myself write this up. Because it  made me google and find a wonderful article by the excellent Noah Smith  who asked exactly this question. 2008: Liquidity crisis, or solvency crisis?He’s quoting Steve Williamson with words that I couldn’t possibly shorten, thus excuse the long quote:  One [the liquidity crisis] view is that the fragility is inherent to  financial systems. This view is framed in some versions of the  Diamond-Dybvig model, in which the maturity mismatch and illiquidity  inherent in banking imply that bank panics are possible. An alternative  [the solvency crisis] view is that the fragility is induced…a  too-big-to-fail financial institution understands that it is  too-big-to-fail, and therefore takes on too much risk, relative to what  is socially optimal…This high level of risk could be reflected, for  example, in a high-aggregate-risk asset portfolio, or in a maturity  mismatch between assets an liabilities…[I]t is possible that Lehman  Brothers could have taken corrective action…to ward off failure, if it  had correctly anticipated that a bailout would not occur.Noah then concludes by writing, that he himself is undecided whether 2008  was a liquidity or a solvency crisis. But the distinction is  fundamentally important because of the policy implications they carry.  While the solvency perspective holds the “Moral Hazard” explanation for  us and leads to stability mechanisms that focus on monitoring and  bailing out (fiscal policy), the liquidity perspective focusses on  deposit insurance and, yes, liquidity ratios — thus also monitoring,  lender/dealer of last resort facilities by central banks (monetary  policy).The article is quite complex. I just spent an hour and a half diving into the theoretical papers Noah quotes. On the Diamond-Dybvig model, or on herding, here or at the FED. And I ponder how much I actually know about what happened in 2008 and how much I just learned through writing this down.Following this short theoretical excursion, I would like to share two thoughts  about how this distinction is important to a democratic, political  public. Namely, I argue that increasing plurality of perspectives as in  ways to make sense of “reality” adds democratic steadfastness as it  offers positions to take and argue for instead of a “there is no  alternative”-narrative. Second, on a broader but also more concrete  note, I argue that major changes in monetary and fiscal policy personnel need to be much stronger publicly controlled.Democratization of financial knowledge means adding complexityAn argument about current politics and a public discontent with it is that levels of complexity in our current world aren’t addressed thoroughly  enough. This obviously becomes apparent in topics of the financial or  euro crisis, crisis management or resulting monetary policy like QE.With this in mind, I pose the question of: How much would it be good for a  democratic society to understand the details of what happened in the  last financial crisis, that still has its effects with rising rents,  unemployment, pension losses and the still ongoing greek disaster. Does  it matter to this public whether to look at the crisis in terms of a  liquidity or solvency perspective?Would we, with adding an activity to our banking crisis material that covers a liquidity crisis perspective, add to the perceived over-complexity of  finance that must as a consequence have the reaction of “fuck it, too  complex, don’t give me more perspectives, let Mario decide”?Like, warding off any more complexity?I don’t think so. I think opening up new perspectives to a situation,  discussing them or just simply trying to understand them would add  exactly to our democratic process what we are missing at the moment.  Understanding the issues of liquidity is much harder than understanding  solvency. We all know what happens when we individually run out of money in the bank. But with a growing financial industry it makes sense to  pursue understanding of what a funding crisis is. Because as Perry  Mehrling would put it: Liquidity kills quick.Also, the implied “moral hazard” in the solvency perspective always left me  somewhat puzzled. It seems to come down to “greedy” bankers so much, to  the “nature” of human beings to be rapacious. This is countered by the  systemic explanations like those of herding or Minsky’s inherent  financial instability. If the naturalistic assumption humans just  individually being ex ante greedy holds, we should wonder if there is  any path out of thus created financial instability at all. A systematic  perspective on the other hand doesn’t offer quick policy responses like  raising capital buffers, but it may offer long term approaches to  financial stability, targeting the inherent asset-liability mismatch of  every financial agent who is interwoven into the financial fabric.Perry’s Money View with his elasticity-discipline-approach (which is by the way super useful for explaining current surges in  equity, private equity, real estate and even “crypto”) actually suggests embracing both perspectives as being true descriptions of “reality” and the swinging pendulum between scarcity of (ultimate) money and elasticity of (derivative) credit makes for two perceptions — solvency vs. liquidity — on the same issue.A political debate on the two perspectives and their implications touches basic questions of “how we treat each other” (see moral hazard) or  “what role the law should play in human interaction” (see policy).  Teaching a plurality of ideas, embracing the controversy, even  opposites, strengthens democratic steadfastness by bringing the fresh  wind of new vocabulary to describe one’s reality.The role of monetary and fiscal policy personnelMonetary policy and financial regulation should be carried out and decided on by highly trained people who can still feel emotions and not act as robots catering to “the market”. But for that to happen the above mentioned  democratic public needs the tools and the knowledge to control these  experts.Next year Mario Draghi is set to leave the top post at the ECB. In Germany’s last year federal elections the conservative Bundesbank chief’s  nomination to his replacement wasn’t among the topics discussed by  political parties. Installing the hardliner Weidmann as the Eurozone’s  top financial regulator and central banker wasn’t part of this  democratic process. A shame.Also, this week Germany’s freshly baked Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz made a statement that fits into my reasoning. For reference, Scholz is now  replacing his eight-year-predecessor Wolfgang Schäuble who is famous for his anti-european and Germany-first agenda during the euro-crisis.  Also, he is the politician who during a time of record low interest  rates and a record high infrastructure investment backlog, is proud of  the “black zero”, indicating a happiness for a balanced federal budget  with no added government deficit.Scholz now this week stepped in front of international press and said he will stick to the “black zero” and: “A German finance  minister is a German finance minister, the party affiliation plays no  role there”. Mr Scholz should ask himself whether his voters voted for  the obscure role of “a German finance minister” or for the  social-democratic party he is part of. With his SPD on the brink of  being a relevant party the party-head should take democratic decision  making seriously and not pursue the same agenda his conservative  predecessor propagated. Because there are alternatives. Teaching about  them could make them gain traction.Re-power the financial society, bottom upAnd here is finally where I make full circle back to the activity about  solvency, on how Commerzbank was rescued. This understanding in a  general public is important. Offering alternative perspectives will  always add to democratic decision making strength. Getting a feel of what happened in the crisis into the public remains a target for all of us who’s job it is to teach and  think about finance. Deciding on the steps to be taken should be a  democratic process that necessarily has a bunch of alternatives to  choose from. An explanation that focusses on solvency and one that  focusses on liquidity. And best: One on hearding, too. Financial Society is the name of our time and educational material that captures our core interlinkings democratizes knowledge to re-power, bottom-up."

    "content": "What’s the meaning of those numbers? What do they express or represent? (Picture by Tim EvansIf I say “economics”, do you hear “numbers”? Thats the case with most  people and actually most professors on the topic as well. I think thats  not just a flawed perspective but plainly false.If economics is the “study of the ways societies organize themselves to  provide for the survival and flourishing of life”, then economics is  just as much about telling stories as it can be about numbers. By the  way, thanks to July Nelson for that great definition.Mostly, I hear that economics has a lot to do with calculating aggregate  numbers such as GDP, unemployment-outlooks, exchange rates or predicting propensities to save. That is all well and fine, but the point is, if I have no story to tell with such a number, the number itself is becoming meaningless.When we set out researching for YourGreeconomy, we read all about unemployment rates in Greece. Soaring numbers, many fleeing the country.Let me ask you this: What do you make of a piece of information that tells you “Youth unemployment is at 57%”?The only thought that came to my mind was: “Gosh, thats a lot of people not finding a job.” That’s not very informative, though. That’s not very  much meaning.  The meaning of something is what it expresses or represents. (Cambridge Dictionary)So, what does a number like 57% youth unemployment express or represent?It represents young people like myself who would rather stay where they  grew up, indulge in their families, foster communities and spread  knowledge. But they can’t. Because they can’t live on their parents  shrinking income forever.That number represents young people like myself who grew up into a  globalized economy, speaking a multitude of languages and being raised  in this thinking of factor-mobility. If I ask around my friends in  Germany most would go work abroad for a while, check it out, see what it is they want to do. If you ask around the young and well educated in  Greece, they say they have to leave the country.And thats a huge difference. And those are stories, not numbers. Stories of how you feel if you have to leave to be able to pay for your families  rent. Stories of how doing something you’ve been educated for, forces  you to look somewhere else. Leaving behind your friends, family,  infrastructure. Having your family scatter all around europe.In this regard, numbers are tools to tell stories. As are models and  formulas. But the numbers can never stand for themselves. Neither can  models and formulas.There is a caveat keeping uns from telling stories in economics, though: It  makes information much less accessible. Telling stories doesn’t give you a imagined “clear picture”. And that’s the problem: If you hear a  number on something, you perceive to have a clear understanding of a  process, while hearing a story on the topic leaves you with this unclear gut feeling.Clear pictures lead to clear responses: Greece is broke? Have it cut  spending. Bloated public sector? Privatize. But as there is never a single cause, there can never be a single response. Stories open up perspectives  maybe not so much on causes, but on what responses would work like.And that’s the great thing about stories. A well told story gives you  mediated, hands-on understanding of something. You’ll have a mediated  experience to be someone else. You’ll be able to feel the way the  narrator feels. You can be empathetic.And that’s what economics needs to be, if we want to use it to build a  better world. Have economics be about empathy and use numbers to  illustrate your story. It would fit so greatly with Judy Nelson’s  definition of the field."

    "content": "Which way to go when futures are insecure and a crisis blocks your view. Picture by Mike Wilson.I spent roughly two weeks in Greece last year, filming a documentary. The idea was to capture stories of young adults of what they’d been facing  these past couple of years that we came to calling crisis. What resulted from filming is a 40-minute documentary with talking heads on the topic. But the outcome for me is much more  than an answer to the question we’d asked. Its the start of a journey of getting to known people of my age.I think our film answers this question of “what happened” and “how does  it feel” in its own way. The story I am trying to tell here is a  different one, though. It has much more to do with the reactions we  received for showing the film. The discussion I’ve had with audiences  and friends who’d asked questions.The film shows six young people between 22 and 26 years old and in many  ways they reflect on their situation. When we showed the film in Berlin, someone afterwards asked: “What’s the big deal? All of what the people in your film said could have been young people from Berlin-Kreuzberg.” I was first taken aback and figured after all the work that had flown  into this, there was no story we were telling. But thats not what I  think is true.The story this film is telling, lays underneath all those statements that  are made throughout the film. In a way the story the film tells is  exactly what this guy in Berlin said:  “Look at us, we are the same as so many young people in Europe and probably  world-wide. We are insecure about our futures, we are highly educated,  we worry about how to fit in and never want to fit in, we try to find  our ways, and we keep telling ourselves to do something that makes us happy.”A scene from the film: Interviewing with Irini on hill of philopappou.Irini — one of our interview partners actually said just that in the film.  She has a job that pays for her expenses. But that’s not what she’d been looking for. Before the crisis her parents, her teachers and everyone  else kept telling her: “You can be and do whatever you want!” And the  crisis suddenly revealed that to be a lie. The crisis in a nutshell for  these young people was a rupture into a system of believes, emotions and feelings of how the world works and what the future would bring.And it is this theme that interests me. This theme of “a young generation”  that is insecure but highly emotional, that in Greece got a mean slap in the face.This film gave me the opportunity to meet people my age whom I didn’t know  before and then ask them personal questions on what happened. And we  recorded all of those conversations. And I watched them again and again  while cutting. And we as the filming team constructed a narrative from  all of those singular stories. And then we opened up discourse on the  topic to a public.This film gave me the opportunity to speak with and listen about my generation. Its a form of dialogue that I am missing so far."

    "content": "I made logo and website for Kritische Wirtschaftswissenschaften Göttingen. They are a student initiative promoting pluralism in economics, teaching and research at Göttingen University.Logo was made using Illustrator and selected from six prototypes. It tries to capture pluralism in thought through differing perspectives and offer a clean and professional attire.The website utilizes standard wordpress for ease of use of its GUI and blogging features. I heavily adjusted Quema Labs’ Vito theme and employ along others Event Organizer plugin by Stephen Harris for events. WP Clone by WP Academy was especially useful for deploying the page initially."
